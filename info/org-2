14.8 Bugs
=========

Here is a list of things that should work differently, but which I have
found too hard to fix.

   * If a table field starts with a link, and if the corresponding table
     column is narrowed (*note Narrow columns::) to a width too small to
     display the link, the field would look entirely empty even though
     it is not.  To prevent this, Org-mode throws an error.  The
     work-around is to make the column wide enough to fit the link, or
     to add some text (at least 2 characters) before the link in the
     same field.

   * Narrowing table columns does not work on XEmacs, because the
     `format' function does not transport text properties.

   * Text in an entry protected with the `QUOTE' keyword should not
     autowrap.

   * When the application called by `C-c C-o' to open a file link fails
     (for example because the application does not exist or refuses to
     open the file), it does so silently.  No error message is
     displayed.

   * Recalculating a table line applies the formulas from left to right.
     If a formula uses _calculated_ fields further down the row,
     multiple recalculation may be needed to get all fields consistent.
     You may use the command `org-table-iterate' (`C-u C-c *') to
     recalculate until convergence.

   * A single letter cannot be made bold, for example `*a*'.

   * The exporters work well, but could be made more efficient.

A.1 Third-party extensions for Org-mode
=======================================

The following extensions for Org-mode have been written by other people:

`org-publish.el' by David O'Toole
     This package provides facilities for publishing related sets of
     Org-mode files together with linked files like images as webpages.
     It is highly configurable and can be used for other publishing
     purposes as well.  As of Org-mode version 4.30, `org-publish.el'
     is part of the Org-mode distribution.  It is not yet part of
     Emacs, however, a delay caused by the preparations for the 22.1
     release.  In the mean time, `org-publish.el' can be downloaded
     from David's site: `http://dto.freeshell.org/e/org-publish.el'.  

`org-mouse.el' by Piotr Zielinski
     This package implements extended mouse functionality for Org-mode.
     It allows you to cycle visibility and to edit the document
     structure with the mouse.  Best of all, it provides a
     context-sensitive menu on <mouse-3> that changes depending on the
     context of a mouse-click.  As of Org-mode version 4.53,
     `org-mouse.el' is part of the Org-mode distribution.  It is not
     yet part of Emacs, however, a delay caused by the preparations for
     the 22.1 release.  In the mean time, `org-mouse.el' can be
     downloaded from Piotr's site:
     `http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pz215/files/org-mouse.el'.  

`org-blog.el' by David O'Toole
     A blogging plug-in for `org-publish.el'.
     `http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgMode.html'.  

`blorg.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Publish Org-mode files as blogs.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/blorg.html'.  

`org2rem.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Translates Org-mode files into something readable by Remind.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org2rem.el'.

`org-toc.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Produces a simple table of contents of an Org-mode file, for easy
     navigation.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org-registry.el'.

`org-registry.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Find which Org-file link to a certain document.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org2rem.el'.

A.2 Adding hyperlink types
==========================

Org-mode has a large number of hyperlink types built-in (*note
Hyperlinks::).  If you would like to add new link types, it provides an
interface for doing so.  Lets look at an example file `org-man.el' that
will add support for creating links like `[[man:printf][The printf
manpage]]' to show unix manual pages inside emacs:

     ;;; org-man.el - Support for links to manpages in Org-mode

     (require 'org)

     (org-add-link-type "man" 'org-man-open)
     (add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-man-store-link)

     (defcustom org-man-command 'man
       "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
       :group 'org-link
       :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

     (defun org-man-open (path)
       "Visit the manpage on PATH.
     PATH should be a topic that can be thrown at the man command."
       (funcall org-man-command path))

     (defun org-man-store-link ()
       "Store a link to a manpage."
       (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
         ;; This is a man page, we do make this link
         (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
                (link (concat "man:" page))
                (description (format "Manpage for %s" page)))
           (org-store-link-props
            :type "man"
            :link link
            :description description))))

     (defun org-man-get-page-name ()
       "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
       ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
       (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
           (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
         (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

     (provide 'org-man)

     ;;; org-man.el ends here

You would activate this new link type in `.emacs' with

     (require 'org-man)

Lets go through the file and see what it does.
  1. It does `(require 'org)' to make sure that `org.el' has been
     loaded.

  2. The next line calls `org-add-link-type' to define a new link type
     with prefix `man'.  The call also contains the name of a function
     that will be called to follow such a link.

  3. The next line adds a function to `org-store-link-functions', in
     order to allow the command `C-c l' to record a useful link in a
     buffer displaying a man page.

   The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which emacs
command should be used to display manpages.  There are two options,
`man' and `woman'.  Then the function to follow a link is defined.  It
gets the link path as an argument - in this case the link path is just
a topic for the manual command.  The function calls the value of
`org-man-command' to display the man page.

   Finally the function `org-man-store-link' is defined.  When you try
to store a link with `C-c l', also this function will be called to try
to make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type, we do this by checking the value
of the variable `major-mode'.  If not, the function must exit and
retunr the value `nil'.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual tpoic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
`man:'.  Then it must call the command `org-store-link-props' and set
the `:type' and `:link' properties.  Optionally you can also set the
`:description' property to provide a default for the link description
when the link is later inserted into tan Org-mode buffer with `C-c C-l'.

A.3 Tables and Lists in arbitrary syntax
========================================

Since Orgtbl-mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example LaTeX.  However, this is extremely hard
to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare, and
would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl-mode table editor.

   This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the
Orgtbl-mode table in its native format (the source table), and use a
custom function to translate the table to the correct syntax, and to
install it in the right location (the target table).  This puts the
burden of writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows for a
very flexible system.

   Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists.  You can use
Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by turning `orgstruct-mode'
on, then locally exporting such lists in another format (HTML, LaTeX or
TeXInfo.)

* Menu:

* Radio tables::                Sending and receiving
* A LaTeX example::             Step by step, almost a tutorial
* Translator functions::        Copy and modify
* Radio lists::                 Doing the same for lists.


File: org,  Node: Radio tables,  Next: A LaTeX example,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.3.1 Radio tables
------------------

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words for
Orgtbl-mode to find.  Orgtbl-mode will insert the translated table
between these lines, replacing whatever was there before.  For example:

     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */

Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells
Orgtbl-mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For
example:
     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments....

`table_name' is the reference name for the table that is also used in
the receiver lines. `translation_function' is the Lisp function that
does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

`:skip N'
     Skip the first N lines of the table. Hlines do count!

`:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)'
     List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column
     with calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as
     well.  Please note that the translator function sees the table
     _after_ the removal of these columns, the function never knows
     that there have been additional columns.

The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a LaTeX file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

   * The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported
     by the language.  For example, in C-mode you could wrap the table
     between `/*' and `*/' lines.

   * Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of END
     statement, for example `\bye' in TeX and `\end{document}' in LaTeX.

   * You can just comment the table line by line whenever you want to
     process the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the
     table.  This only sounds tedious - the command `M-x
     orgtbl-toggle-comment' does make this comment-toggling very easy,
     in particular if you bind it to a key.

A.3.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables
-------------------------------------

The best way to wrap the source table in LaTeX is to use the `comment'
environment provided by `comment.sty'.  It has to be activated by
placing `\usepackage{comment}' into the document header.  Orgtbl-mode
can insert a radio table skeleton(1)  with the command `M-x
orgtbl-insert-radio-table'.  You will be prompted for a table name,
lets say we use `salesfigures'.  You will then get the following
template:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | | |
     \end{comment}

The `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line tells orgtbl-mode to use the function
`orgtbl-to-latex' to convert the table into LaTeX and to put it into
the receiver location with name `salesfigures'.  You may now fill in
the table, feel free to use the spreadsheet features(2):

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     % $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
     \end{comment}

When you are done, press `C-c C-c' in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

   Now lets assume you want to make the table header by hand, because
you want to control how columns are aligned etc.  In this case we make
sure that the table translator does skip the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a splice, i.e. to not produce
header and footer commands of the target table:

     \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
     Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \end{tabular}
     %
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     \end{comment}

   The LaTeX translator function `orgtbl-to-latex' is already part of
Orgtbl-mode.  It uses a `tabular' environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with `\hline'.  Furthermore, it interprets the
following parameters:

`:splice nil/t'
     When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
     tabular environment.  Default is nil.

`:fmt fmt'
     A format to be used to wrap each field, should contain `%s' for the
     original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value in
     dollars, you could use `:fmt "$%s$"'.  This may also be a property
     list with column numbers and formats. for example `:fmt (2 "$%s$"
     4 "%s\\%%")'.

`:efmt efmt'
     Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format
     should have `%s' twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for
     example `"%s\\times10^{%s}"'.  The default is `"%s\\,(%s)"'.  This
     may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for
     example `:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")'.
     After `efmt' has been applied to a value, `fmt' will also be
     applied.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By default this works only for LaTeX, HTML, and TeXInfo.
Configure the variable `orgtbl-radio-tables' to install templates for
other modes.

   (2) If the `#+TBLFM' line contains an odd number of dollar
characters, this may cause problems with font-lock in latex-mode.  As
shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
`comment' environment that is used to balance the dollar expressions.
If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a much better
solution is to add the `comment' environment to the variable
`LaTeX-verbatim-environments'.

A.3.3 Translator functions
--------------------------

Orgtbl-mode has several translator functions built-in:
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-html', and `orgtbl-to-texinfo'.  Except
for `orgtbl-to-html'(1), these all use a generic translator,
`orgtbl-to-generic'.  For example, `orgtbl-to-latex' itself is a very
short function that computes the column definitions for the `tabular'
environment, defines a few field and line separators and then hands
over to the generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

     (defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
       "Convert the orgtbl-mode TABLE to LaTeX."
       (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                                    org-table-last-alignment ""))
              (params2
               (list
                :tstart (concat "\\begin{tabular}{" alignment "}")
                :tend "\\end{tabular}"
                :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
                :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
         (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))

   As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
PARAMS) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable PARAMS2).  The ones passed into the function (i.e. the ones
set by the `ORGTBL SEND' line) take precedence.  So if you would like
to use the LaTeX translator, but wanted the line endings to be
`\\[2mm]' instead of the default `\\', you could just overrule the
default with

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"

   For a new language, you can either write your own converter function
in analogy with the LaTeX translator, or you can use the generic
function directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table
is started with `!BTBL!', ended with `!ETBL!', and where table lines are
started with `!BL!', ended with `!EL!' and where the field separator is
a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on a single
line!):

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                                   :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"

Please check the documentation string of the function
`orgtbl-to-generic' for a full list of parameters understood by that
function and remember that you can pass each of them into
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-texinfo', and any other function using
the generic function.

   Of course you can also write a completely new function doing
complicated things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator
function takes two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list
of lines, each line either the symbol `hline' or a list of fields.  The
second argument is the property list containing all parameters
specified in the `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line.  The function must return a
single string containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally
useful translator, please post it on `emacs-orgmode@gnu.org' so that
others can benefit from your work.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The HTML translator uses the same code that produces tables
during HTML export.

A.3.4 Radio lists
-----------------

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way than
sending and receiving radio tables (*note Radio tables::) (1).  As for
radio tables, you can insert radio lists templates in HTML, LaTeX and
TeXInfo modes by calling `org-list-insert-radio-list'.

   Here are the differences with radio tables:

   - Use `ORGLST' instead of `ORGTBL'.

   - The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
     parameters.

   - `C-c C-c' will work when pressed on the first item of the list.

   Here is a LaTeX example.  Let's say that you have this in your LaTeX
file:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     % END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGLIST: SEND to-buy orgtbl-to-latex
     - a new house
     - a new computer
       + a new keyboard
       + a new mouse
     - a new life
     \end{comment}

   Pressing `C-c C-c' on `a new house' and will insert the converted
LaTeX list between the two marker lines.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You need to load the `org-export-latex.el' package to use radio
lists since the relevant code is there for now.


File: org,  Node: Dynamic blocks,  Next: Special agenda views,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Extensions and Hacking

A.4 Dynamic blocks
==================

Org-mode documents can contain _dynamic blocks_.  These are specially
marked regions that are updated by some user-written function.  A good
example for such a block is the clock table inserted by the command
`C-c C-x C-r' (*note Clocking work time::).

   Dynamic block are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a
name to the block and can also specify parameters for the function
producing the content of the block.

     #+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

     #+END:

   Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.

   Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN
and END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  If you want
to use the original content in the writer function, you can use the
extra parameter `:content'.

   For a block with name `myblock', the writer function is
`org-dblock-write:myblock' with as only parameter a property list with
the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example of a
block that keeps track of when the block update function was last run:

     #+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

     #+END:

The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

     (defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
        (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
          (insert "Last block update at: "
                  (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))

   If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always
up-to-date, you could add the function `org-update-all-dblocks' to a
hook, for example `before-save-hook'.  `org-update-all-dblocks' is
written in a way that is does nothing in buffers that are not in
Org-mode.


File: org,  Node: Special agenda views,  Next: Using the property API,  Prev: Dynamic blocks,  Up: Extensions and Hacking

A.5 Special Agenda Views
========================

Org-mode provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by any of the agenda views.  You may specify a function
that is used at each match to verify if the match should indeed be part
of the agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.

   Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a
WAITING tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that
you have marked all tree headings that define a project with the todo
keyword PROJECT.  In this case you would run a todo search for the
keyword PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag
anywhere in the subtree belonging to the project line.

   To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree
for the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return `nil' to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

     (defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
       "Skip trees that are not waiting"
       (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
         (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
             nil          ; tag found, do not skip
           subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree

   Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for
example like this:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-org-waiting-projects)
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   Note that this also binds `org-agenda-overriding-header' to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

   You may also put a Lisp form into `org-agenda-skip-function'.  In
particular, you may use the functions `org-agenda-skip-entry-if' and
`org-agenda-skip-subtree-if' in this form, for example:

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry 'notregexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

`'(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.

   Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                     'regexp ":waiting:"))
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

A.6 Using the property API
==========================

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

 -- Function: org-entry-properties &optional pom which
     Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.  This
     includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for deadline,
     scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties defined in
     the entry.  The return value is an alist, keys may occur multiple
     times if the property key was used several times.  POM may also be
     nil, in which case the current entry is used.  If WHICH is nil or
     `all', get all properties.  If WHICH is `special' or `standard',
     only get that subclass.

 -- Function: org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
     Get value of PROPERTY for entry at point-or-marker POM.  If
     INHERIT is non-nil and the entry does not have the property, then
     also check higher levels of the hierarchy.  This function ignores
     the value of `org-use-property-inheritance' and requires the
     explicit INHERIT flag.

 -- Function: org-entry-delete pom property
     Delete the property PROPERTY from entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-entry-put pom property value
     Set PROPERTY to VALUE for entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
     Get all property keys in the current buffer.

 -- Function: org-insert-property-drawer
     Insert a property drawer at point.

Appendix B History and Acknowledgments
**************************************

Org-mode was borne in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface
of the Emacs outline-mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and
projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However,
having to remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per
command, only to hide and unhide parts of the outline tree, that seemed
entirely unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly want to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  _Visibility cycling_ and _structure editing_ were
originally implemented in the package `outline-magic.el', but quickly
moved to the more general `org.el'.  As this environment became
comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding _TODO
entries_, basic _time stamps_, and _table support_.  These areas
highlight the two main goals that Org-mode still has today: To create a
new, outline-based, plain text mode with innovative and intuitive
editing features, and to incorporate project planning functionality
directly into a notes file.

   Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or on
`emacs-orgmode@gnu.org' have provided a constant stream of bug reports,
feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many
thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying
to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence in
shaping one or more aspects of Org-mode.  The list may not be complete,
if I have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.

   * Russel Adams came up with the idea for drawers.

   * Thomas Baumann contributed the code for links to the MH-E email
     system.

   * Alex Bochannek provided a patch for rounding time stamps.

   * Charles Cave's suggestion sparked the implementation of templates
     for Remember.

   * Pavel Chalmoviansky influenced the agenda treatment of items with
     specified time.

   * Gregory Chernov patched support for lisp forms into table
     calculations and improved XEmacs compatibility, in particular by
     porting `nouline.el' to XEmacs.

   * Sacha Chua suggested to copy some linking code from Planner.

   * Eddward DeVilla proposed and tested checkbox statistics.  He also
     came up with the idea of properties, and that there should be an
     API for them.

   * Kees Dullemond used to edit projects lists directly in HTML and so
     inspired some of the early development, including HTML export.  He
     also asked for a way to narrow wide table columns.

   * Christian Egli converted the documentation into TeXInfo format,
     patched CSS formatting into the HTML exporter, and inspired the
     agenda.

   * David Emery provided a patch for custom CSS support in exported
     HTML agendas.

   * Nic Ferrier contributed mailcap and XOXO support.

   * Miguel A. Figueroa-Villanueva implemented hierarchical checkboxes.

   * John Foerch figured out how to make incremental search show context
     around a match in a hidden outline tree.

   * Niels Giesen had the idea to automatically archive DONE trees.

   * Bastien Guerry wrote the LaTeX exporter and has been prolific with
     patches, ideas, and bug reports.

   * Kai Grossjohann pointed out key-binding conflicts with other
     packages.

   * Scott Jaderholm proposed footnotes, control over whitespace between
     folded entries, and column view for properties.

   * Shidai Liu ("Leo") asked for embedded LaTeX and tested it.  He also
     provided frequent feedback and some patches.

   * Jason F. McBrayer suggested agenda export to CSV format.

   * Max Mikhanosha came up with the idea of refiling.

   * Dmitri Minaev sent a patch to set priority limits on a per-file
     basis.

   * Stefan Monnier provided a patch to keep the Emacs-Lisp compiler
     happy.

   * Rick Moynihan proposed to allow multiple TODO sequences in a file
     and to be able to quickly restrict the agenda to a subtree.

   * Todd Neal provided patches for links to Info files and elisp forms.

   * Tim O'Callaghan suggested in-file links, search options for general
     file links, and TAGS.

   * Takeshi Okano translated the manual and David O'Toole's tutorial
     into Japanese.

   * Oliver Oppitz suggested multi-state TODO items.

   * Scott Otterson sparked the introduction of descriptive text for
     links, among other things.

   * Pete Phillips helped during the development of the TAGS feature,
     and provided frequent feedback.

   * T.V. Raman reported bugs and suggested improvements.

   * Matthias Rempe (Oelde) provided ideas, Windows support, and quality
     control.

   * Kevin Rogers contributed code to access VM files on remote hosts.

   * Frank Ruell solved the mystery of the `keymapp nil' bug, a
     conflict with `allout.el'.

   * Jason Riedy sent a patch to fix a bug with export of TODO keywords.

   * Philip Rooke created the Org-mode reference card and provided lots
     of feedback.

   * Christian Schlauer proposed angular brackets around links, among
     other things.

   * Linking to VM/BBDB/GNUS was inspired by Tom Shannon's
     `organizer-mode.el'.

   * Daniel Sinder came up with the idea of internal archiving by
     locking subtrees.

   * Dale Smith proposed link abbreviations.

   * Adam Spiers asked for global linking commands and inspired the link
     extension system.  support mairix.

   * David O'Toole wrote `org-publish.el' and drafted the manual
     chapter about publishing.

   * Ju"rgen Vollmer contributed code generating the table of contents
     in HTML output.

   * Chris Wallace provided a patch implementing the `QUOTE' keyword.

   * David Wainberg suggested archiving, and improvements to the linking
     system.

   * John Wiegley wrote `emacs-wiki.el' and `planner.el'.  The
     development of Org-mode was fully independent, and both systems are
     really different beasts in their basic ideas and implementation
     details.  I later looked at John's code, however, and learned from
     his implementation of (i) links where the link itself is hidden
     and only a description is shown, and (ii) popping up a calendar to
     select a date.  John has also contributed a number of great ideas
     directly to Org-mode.

   * Carsten Wimmer suggested some changes and helped fix a bug in
     linking to GNUS.

   * Roland Winkler requested additional keybindings to make Org-mode
     work on a tty.

   * Piotr Zielinski wrote `org-mouse.el', proposed agenda blocks and
     contributed various ideas and code snippets.
