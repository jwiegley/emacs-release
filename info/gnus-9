Easy Picons
-----------

   To enable displaying picons, simply put the following line in your
`~/.gnus' file and start Gnus.

     (setq gnus-use-picons t)
     (add-hook 'gnus-article-display-hook 'gnus-article-display-picons t)
     (add-hook 'gnus-summary-prepare-hook 'gnus-group-display-picons t)
     (add-hook 'gnus-article-display-hook 'gnus-picons-article-display-x-face)

Hard Picons
-----------

   Gnus can display picons for you as you enter and leave groups and
articles.  It knows how to interact with three sections of the picons
database.  Namely, it can display the picons newsgroup pictures,
author's face picture(s), and the authors domain.  To enable this
feature, you need to first decide where to display them.

`gnus-picons-display-where'
     Where the picon images should be displayed.  It is `picons' by
     default (which by default maps to the buffer `*Picons*').  Other
     valid places could be `article', `summary', or `*scratch*' for all
     I care.  Just make sure that you've made the buffer visible using
     the standard Gnus window configuration routines--*note Windows
     Configuration::..

   Note: If you set `gnus-use-picons' to `t', it will set up your
window configuration for you to include the `picons' buffer.

   Now that you've made that decision, you need to add the following
functions to the appropriate hooks so these pictures will get displayed
at the right time.

`gnus-article-display-picons'
     Looks up and display the picons for the author and the author's
     domain in the `gnus-picons-display-where' buffer.  Should be added
     to the `gnus-article-display-hook'.

`gnus-group-display-picons'
     Displays picons representing the current group.  This function
     should be added to the `gnus-summary-prepare-hook' or to the
     `gnus-article-display-hook' if `gnus-picons-display-where' is set
     to `article'.

`gnus-picons-article-display-x-face'
     Decodes and displays the X-Face header if present.  This function
     should be added to `gnus-article-display-hook'.

   Note:  You must append them to the hook, so make sure to specify 't'
to the append flag of `add-hook':

     (add-hook 'gnus-article-display-hook 'gnus-article-display-picons t)

Picon Configuration
-------------------

   The following variables offer further control over how things are
done, where things are located, and other useless stuff you really
don't need to worry about.

`gnus-picons-database'
     The location of the picons database.  Should point to a directory
     containing the `news', `domains', `users' (and so on)
     subdirectories.  Defaults to `/usr/local/faces'.

`gnus-picons-news-directory'
     Sub-directory of the faces database containing the icons for
     newsgroups.

`gnus-picons-user-directories'
     List of subdirectories to search in `gnus-picons-database' for user
     faces.  `("local" "users" "usenix" "misc/MISC")' is the default.

`gnus-picons-domain-directories'
     List of subdirectories to search in `gnus-picons-database' for
     domain name faces.  Defaults to `("domains")'.  Some people may
     want to add `unknown' to this list.

`gnus-picons-convert-x-face'
     The command to use to convert the `X-Face' header to an X bitmap
     (`xbm').  Defaults to `(format "{ echo '/* Width=48, Height=48
     */'; uncompface; } | icontopbm | pbmtoxbm > %s"
     gnus-picons-x-face-file-name)'

`gnus-picons-x-face-file-name'
     Names a temporary file to store the `X-Face' bitmap in.  Defaults
     to `(format "/tmp/picon-xface.%s.xbm" (user-login-name))'.

`gnus-picons-buffer'
     The name of the buffer that `picons' points to.  Defaults to
     `*Icon Buffer*'.

Undo
====

   It is very useful to be able to undo actions one has done.  In normal
Emacs buffers, it's easy enough--you just push the `undo' button.  In
Gnus buffers, however, it isn't that simple.

   The things Gnus displays in its buffer is of no value whatsoever to
Gnus--it's all just data that is designed to look nice to the user.
Killing a group in the group buffer with `C-k' makes the line
disappear, but that's just a side-effect of the real action--the
removal of the group in question from the internal Gnus structures.
Undoing something like that can't be done by the normal Emacs `undo'
function.

   Gnus tries to remedy this somewhat by keeping track of what the user
does and coming up with actions that would reverse the actions the user
takes.  When the user then presses the `undo' key, Gnus will run the
code to reverse the previous action, or the previous actions.  However,
not all actions are easily reversible, so Gnus currently offers a few
key functions to be undoable.  These include killing groups, yanking
groups, and changing the list of read articles of groups.  That's it,
really.  More functions may be added in the future, but each added
function means an increase in data to be stored, so Gnus will never be
totally undoable.

   The undoability is provided by the `gnus-undo-mode' minor mode.  It
is used if `gnus-use-undo' is non-`nil', which is the default.  The
`M-C-_' key performs the `gnus-undo' command command, which should feel
kinda like the normal Emacs `undo' command.

Moderation
==========

   If you are a moderator, you can use the `gnus-mdrtn.el' package.  It
is not included in the standard Gnus package.  Write a mail to
`larsi@gnus.org' and state what group you moderate, and you'll get a
copy.

   The moderation package is implemented as a minor mode for summary
buffers.  Put

     (add-hook 'gnus-summary-mode-hook 'gnus-moderate)

   in your `.gnus.el' file.

   If you are the moderation of `rec.zoofle', this is how it's supposed
to work:

  1. You split your incoming mail by matching on
     `Newsgroups:.*rec.zoofle', which will put all the to-be-posted
     articles in some mail group--for instance, `nnml:rec.zoofle'.

  2. You enter that group once in a while and post articles using the
     `e' (edit-and-post) or `s' (just send unedited) commands.

  3. If, while reading the `rec.zoofle' newsgroup, you happen upon some
     articles that weren't approved by you, you can cancel them with the
     `c' command.

   To use moderation mode in these two groups, say:

     (setq gnus-moderated-list
           "^nnml:rec.zoofle$\\|^rec.zoofle$")

XEmacs Enhancements
===================

   XEmacs is able to display pictures and stuff, so Gnus has taken
advantage of that.  Relevant variables include:

`gnus-xmas-glyph-directory'
     This is where Gnus will look for pictures.  Gnus will normally
     auto-detect this directory, but you may set it manually if you
     have an unusual directory structure.

`gnus-xmas-logo-color-alist'
     This is an alist where the key is a type symbol and the values are
     the foreground and background color of the splash page glyph.

`gnus-xmas-logo-color-style'
     This is the key used to look up the color in the alist described
     above.  Legal values include `flame', `pine', `moss', `irish',
     `sky', `tin', `velvet', `grape', `labia', `berry', `neutral', and
     `september'.

`gnus-use-toolbar'
     If `nil', don't display toolbars.  If non-`nil', it should be one
     of `default-toolbar', `top-toolbar', `bottom-toolbar',
     `right-toolbar', or `left-toolbar'.

`gnus-group-toolbar'
     The toolbar in the group buffer.

`gnus-summary-toolbar'
     The toolbar in the summary buffer.

`gnus-summary-mail-toolbar'
     The toolbar in the summary buffer of mail groups.

`gnus-xmas-modeline-glyph'
     A glyph displayed in all Gnus mode lines.  It is a tiny gnu head by
     default.

Fuzzy Matching
==============

   Gnus provides "fuzzy matching" of `Subject' lines when doing things
like scoring, thread gathering and thread comparison.

   As opposed to regular expression matching, fuzzy matching is very
fuzzy.  It's so fuzzy that there's not even a definition of what
"fuzziness" means, and the implementation has changed over time.

   Basically, it tries to remove all noise from lines before comparing.
`Re: ', parenthetical remarks, white space, and so on, are filtered out
of the strings before comparing the results.  This often leads to
adequate results--even when faced with strings generated by text
manglers masquerading as newsreaders.


File: gnus,  Node: Thwarting Email Spam,  Next: Various Various,  Prev: Fuzzy Matching,  Up: Various

Thwarting Email Spam
====================

   In these last days of the Usenet, commercial vultures are hanging
about and grepping through news like crazy to find email addresses they
can foist off their scams and products to.  As a reaction to this, many
people have started putting nonsense addresses into their `From' lines.
I think this is counterproductive--it makes it difficult for people to
send you legitimate mail in response to things you write, as well as
making it difficult to see who wrote what.  This rewriting may perhaps
be a bigger menace than the unsolicited commercial email itself in the
end.

   The biggest problem I have with email spam is that it comes in under
false pretenses.  I press `g' and Gnus merrily informs me that I have
10 new emails.  I say "Golly gee!  Happy is me!" and selects the mail
group, only to find two pyramid schemes, seven advertisements ("New!
Miracle tonic for growing full, lustrouos hair on your toes!")  and one
mail asking me to repent and find some god.

   This is annoying.

   The way to deal with this is having Gnus split out all spam into a
`spam' mail group (*note Splitting Mail::.).

   First, pick one (1) legal mail address that you can be reached at,
and put it in your `From' header of all your news articles.  (I've
chosen `larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no'.)

     (setq message-default-news-headers
           "From: Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen <larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no>\n")

   Then put the following split rule in `nnmail-split-fancy' (*note
Fancy Mail Splitting::.):

     (
      ...
      (to "larsi@trym.ifi.uio.no"
           (| ("subject" "re:.*" "misc")
              ("references" ".*@.*" "misc")
              "spam"))
      ...
     )

   This says that all mail to this address is suspect, but if it has a
`Subject' that starts with a `Re:' or has a `References' header, it's
probably ok.  All the rest goes to the `spam' group.  (This idea
probably comes from Tim Pierce.)

   In addition, many mail spammers talk directly to your `smtp' server
and do not include your email address explicitly in the `To' header.
Why they do this is unknown--perhaps it's to thwart this twarting
scheme?  In any case, this is trivial to deal with--you just put
anything not addressed to you in the `spam' group by ending your fancy
split rule in this way:

     (
      ...
      (to "larsi" "misc")
      "spam")

   In my experience, this will sort virtually everything into the right
group.  You still have to check the `spam' group from time to time to
check for legitimate mail, though.  If you feel like being a good net
citizen, you can even send off complaints to the proper authorities on
each unsolicited commercial email--at your leisure.

   This works for me.  It allows people an easy way to contact me (they
can just press `r' in the usual way), and I'm not bothered at all with
spam.  It's a win-win situation.  Forging `From' headers to point to
non-existant domains is yucky, in my opinion.

Various Various
===============

`gnus-home-directory'
     All Gnus path variables will be initialized from this variable,
     which defaults to `~/'.

`gnus-directory'
     Most Gnus storage path variables will be initialized from this
     variable, which defaults to the `SAVEDIR' environment variable, or
     `~/News/' if that variable isn't set.

`gnus-default-directory'
     Not related to the above variable at all--this variable says what
     the default directory of all Gnus buffers should be.  If you issue
     commands like `C-x C-f', the prompt you'll get starts in the
     current buffer's default directory.  If this variable is `nil'
     (which is the default), the default directory will be the default
     directory of the buffer you were in when you started Gnus.

`gnus-verbose'
     This variable is an integer between zero and ten.  The higher the
     value, the more messages will be displayed.  If this variable is
     zero, Gnus will never flash any messages, if it is seven (which is
     the default), most important messages will be shown, and if it is
     ten, Gnus won't ever shut up, but will flash so many messages it
     will make your head swim.

`gnus-verbose-backends'
     This variable works the same way as `gnus-verbose', but it applies
     to the Gnus backends instead of Gnus proper.

`nnheader-max-head-length'
     When the backends read straight heads of articles, they all try to
     read as little as possible.  This variable (default 4096) specifies
     the absolute max length the backends will try to read before
     giving up on finding a separator line between the head and the
     body.  If this variable is `nil', there is no upper read bound.
     If it is `t', the backends won't try to read the articles piece by
     piece, but read the entire articles.  This makes sense with some
     versions of `ange-ftp'.

`nnheader-head-chop-length'
     This variable says how big a piece of each article to read when
     doing the operation described above.

`nnheader-file-name-translation-alist'
     This is an alist that says how to translate characters in file
     names.  For instance, if `:' is illegal as a file character in
     file names on your system (you OS/2 user you), you could say
     something like:

          (setq nnheader-file-name-translation-alist
                '((?: . ?_)))

     In fact, this is the default value for this variable on OS/2 and MS
     Windows (phooey) systems.

`gnus-hidden-properties'
     This is a list of properties to use to hide "invisible" text.  It
     is `(invisible t intangible t)' by default on most systems, which
     makes invisible text invisible and intangible.

`gnus-parse-headers-hook'
     A hook called before parsing headers.  It can be used, for
     instance, to gather statistics on the headers fetched, or perhaps
     you'd like to prune some headers.  I don't see why you'd want
     that, though.

`gnus-shell-command-separator'
     String used to separate to shell commands.  The default is `;'.

History
=======

   GNUS was written by Masanobu UMEDA.  When autumn crept up in '94,
Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen grew bored and decided to rewrite Gnus.

   If you want to investigate the person responsible for this outrage,
you can point your (feh!) web browser to
`http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/'.  This is also the primary distribution
point for the new and spiffy versions of Gnus, and is known as The Site
That Destroys Newsrcs And Drives People Mad.

   During the first extended alpha period of development, the new Gnus
was called "(ding) Gnus".  "(ding)" is, of course, short for "ding is
not Gnus", which is a total and utter lie, but who cares?  (Besides,
the "Gnus" in this abbreviation should probably be pronounced "news" as
UMEDA intended, which makes it a more appropriate name, don't you
think?)

   In any case, after spending all that energy on coming up with a new
and spunky name, we decided that the name was *too* spunky, so we
renamed it back again to "Gnus".  But in mixed case.  "Gnus" vs.
"GNUS".  New vs. old.

   The first "proper" release of Gnus 5 was done in November 1995 when
it was included in the Emacs 19.30 distribution (132 (ding) Gnus
releases plus 15 Gnus 5.0 releases).

   In May 1996 the next Gnus generation (aka. "September Gnus" (after 99
releases)) was released under the name "Gnus 5.2" (40 releases).

   On July 28th 1996 work on Red Gnus was begun, and it was released on
January 25th 1997 (after 84 releases) as "Gnus 5.4".

   If you happen upon a version of Gnus that has a name that is
prefixed - "(ding) Gnus", "September Gnus", "Red Gnus", "Quassia Gnus" -
don't panic.  Don't let it know that you're frightened.  Back away.
Slowly.  Whatever you do, don't run.  Walk away, calmly, until you're
out of its reach.  Find a proper released version of Gnus and snuggle up
to that instead.

Why?
----

   What's the point of Gnus?

   I want to provide a "rad", "happening", "way cool" and "hep"
newsreader, that lets you do anything you can think of.  That was my
original motivation, but while working on Gnus, it has become clear to
me that this generation of newsreaders really belong in the stone age.
Newsreaders haven't developed much since the infancy of the net.  If the
volume continues to rise with the current rate of increase, all current
newsreaders will be pretty much useless.  How do you deal with
newsgroups that have thousands of new articles each day?  How do you
keep track of millions of people who post?

   Gnus offers no real solutions to these questions, but I would very
much like to see Gnus being used as a testing ground for new methods of
reading and fetching news.  Expanding on UMEDA-san's wise decision to
separate the newsreader from the backends, Gnus now offers a simple
interface for anybody who wants to write new backends for fetching mail
and news from different sources.  I have added hooks for customizations
everywhere I could imagine useful.  By doing so, I'm inviting every one
of you to explore and invent.

   May Gnus never be complete. `C-u 100 M-x hail-emacs'.


File: gnus,  Node: Compatibility,  Next: Conformity,  Prev: Why?,  Up: History

Compatibility
-------------

   Gnus was designed to be fully compatible with GNUS.  Almost all key
bindings have been kept.  More key bindings have been added, of course,
but only in one or two obscure cases have old bindings been changed.

   Our motto is:
                         In a cloud bones of steel.


   All commands have kept their names.  Some internal functions have
changed their names.

   The `gnus-uu' package has changed drastically. *note Decoding
Articles::..

   One major compatibility question is the presence of several summary
buffers.  All variables that are relevant while reading a group are
buffer-local to the summary buffer they belong in.  Although many
important variables have their values copied into their global
counterparts whenever a command is executed in the summary buffer, this
change might lead to incorrect values being used unless you are careful.

   All code that relies on knowledge of GNUS internals will probably
fail.  To take two examples: Sorting `gnus-newsrc-alist' (or changing
it in any way, as a matter of fact) is strictly verboten.  Gnus
maintains a hash table that points to the entries in this alist (which
speeds up many functions), and changing the alist directly will lead to
peculiar results.

   Old hilit19 code does not work at all.  In fact, you should probably
remove all hilit code from all Gnus hooks (`gnus-group-prepare-hook'
and `gnus-summary-prepare-hook').  Gnus provides various integrated
functions for highlighting.  These are faster and more accurate.  To
make life easier for everybody, Gnus will by default remove all hilit
calls from all hilit hooks.  Uncleanliness!  Away!

   Packages like `expire-kill' will no longer work.  As a matter of
fact, you should probably remove all old GNUS packages (and other code)
when you start using Gnus.  More likely than not, Gnus already does
what you have written code to make GNUS do.  (Snicker.)

   Even though old methods of doing things are still supported, only the
new methods are documented in this manual.  If you detect a new method
of doing something while reading this manual, that does not mean you
have to stop doing it the old way.

   Gnus understands all GNUS startup files.

   Overall, a casual user who hasn't written much code that depends on
GNUS internals should suffer no problems.  If problems occur, please
let me know by issuing that magic command `M-x gnus-bug'.

Conformity
----------

   No rebels without a clue here, ma'am.  We conform to all standards
known to (wo)man.  Except for those standards and/or conventions we
disagree with, of course.

*RFC 822*
     There are no known breaches of this standard.

*RFC 1036*
     There are no known breaches of this standard, either.

*Good Net-Keeping Seal of Approval*
     Gnus has been through the Seal process and failed.  I think it'll
     pass the next inspection.

*Son-of-RFC 1036*
     We do have some breaches to this one.

    *MIME*
          Gnus does no MIME handling, and this standard-to-be seems to
          think that MIME is the bees' knees, so we have major breakage
          here.

    *X-Newsreader*
          This is considered to be a "vanity header", while I consider
          it to be consumer information.  After seeing so many badly
          formatted articles coming from `tin' and `Netscape' I know
          not to use either of those for posting articles.  I would not
          have known that if it wasn't for the `X-Newsreader' header.

   If you ever notice Gnus acting non-compliantly with regards to the
texts mentioned above, don't hesitate to drop a note to Gnus Towers and
let us know.

Emacsen
-------

   Gnus should work on :

   * Emacs 19.32 and up.

   * XEmacs 19.14 and up.

   * Mule versions based on Emacs 19.32 and up.

   Gnus will absolutely not work on any Emacsen older than that.  Not
reliably, at least.

   There are some vague differences between Gnus on the various
platforms--XEmacs features more graphics (a logo and a toolbar)--but
other than that, things should look pretty much the same under all
Emacsen.

every single one of them.  Smooches.  The people on the list have been
tried beyond endurance, what with my "oh, that's a neat idea <type
type>, yup, I'll release it right away <ship off> no wait, that doesn't
work at all <type type>, yup, I'll ship that one off right away <ship
off> no, wait, that absolutely does not work" policy for releases.
Micro$oft--bah.  Amateurs.  I'm *much* worse.  (Or is that "worser"?
"much worser"?  "worsest"?)

   I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Academy for...
oops, wrong show.

   * Masanobu UMEDA--the writer of the original GNUS.

   * Per Abrahamsen--custom, scoring, highlighting and SOUP code (as
     well as numerous other things).

   * Luis Fernandes--design and graphics.

   * Erik Naggum--help, ideas, support, code and stuff.

   * Wes Hardaker--`gnus-picon.el' and the manual section on "picons"
     (*note Picons::.).

   * Brad Miller--`gnus-gl.el' and the GroupLens manual section (*note
     GroupLens::.).

there actually are people who are using Gnus.  Who'd'a thunk it!

(ding) Gnus
...........

   New features in Gnus 5.0/5.1:

   * The look of all buffers can be changed by setting format-like
     variables (*note Group Buffer Format::. and *note Summary Buffer
     Format::.).

   * Local spool and several NNTP servers can be used at once (*note
     Select Methods::.).

   * You can combine groups into virtual groups (*note Virtual
     Groups::.).

   * You can read a number of different mail formats (*note Getting
     Mail::.).  All the mail backends implement a convenient mail
     expiry scheme (*note Expiring Mail::.).

   * Gnus can use various strategies for gathering threads that have
     lost their roots (thereby gathering loose sub-threads into one
     thread) or it can go back and retrieve enough headers to build a
     complete thread (*note Customizing Threading::.).

   * Killed groups can be displayed in the group buffer, and you can
     read them as well (*note Listing Groups::.).

   * Gnus can do partial group updates--you do not have to retrieve the
     entire active file just to check for new articles in a few groups
     (*note The Active File::.).

   * Gnus implements a sliding scale of subscribedness to groups (*note
     Group Levels::.).

   * You can score articles according to any number of criteria (*note
     Scoring::.).  You can even get Gnus to find out how to score
     articles for you (*note Adaptive Scoring::.).

   * Gnus maintains a dribble buffer that is auto-saved the normal Emacs
     manner, so it should be difficult to lose much data on what you
     have read if your machine should go down (*note Auto Save::.).

   * Gnus now has its own startup file (`.gnus') to avoid cluttering up
     the `.emacs' file.

   * You can set the process mark on both groups and articles and
     perform operations on all the marked items (*note
     Process/Prefix::.).

   * You can grep through a subset of groups and create a group from the
     results (*note Kibozed Groups::.).

   * You can list subsets of groups according to, well, anything (*note
     Listing Groups::.).

   * You can browse foreign servers and subscribe to groups from those
     servers (*note Browse Foreign Server::.).

   * Gnus can fetch articles asynchronously on a second connection to
     the server (*note Asynchronous Fetching::.).

   * You can cache articles locally (*note Article Caching::.).

   * The uudecode functions have been expanded and generalized (*note
     Decoding Articles::.).

   * You can still post uuencoded articles, which was a little-known
     feature of GNUS' past (*note Uuencoding and Posting::.).

   * Fetching parents (and other articles) now actually works without
     glitches (*note Finding the Parent::.).

   * Gnus can fetch FAQs and group descriptions (*note Group
     Information::.).

   * Digests (and other files) can be used as the basis for groups
     (*note Document Groups::.).

   * Articles can be highlighted and customized (*note Customizing
     Articles::.).

   * URLs and other external references can be buttonized (*note
     Article Buttons::.).

   * You can do lots of strange stuff with the Gnus window & frame
     configuration (*note Windows Configuration::.).

   * You can click on buttons instead of using the keyboard (*note
     Buttons::.).

Newest Features
---------------

   Also known as the "todo list".  Sure to be implemented before the
next millennium.

   Be afraid.  Be very afraid.

   * Native MIME support is something that should be done.

   * Really do unbinhexing.

   And much, much, much more.  There is more to come than has already
been implemented.  (But that's always true, isn't it?)

   `<URL:http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/rgnus/todo>' is where the actual
up-to-the-second todo list is located, so if you're really curious, you
could point your Web browser over that-a-way.


File: gnus,  Node: Terminology,  Next: Customization,  Prev: History,  Up: Appendices

Terminology
===========

"news"
     This is what you are supposed to use this thing for--reading news.
     News is generally fetched from a nearby NNTP server, and is
     generally publicly available to everybody.  If you post news, the
     entire world is likely to read just what you have written, and
     they'll all snigger mischievously.  Behind your back.

"mail"
     Everything that's delivered to you personally is mail.  Some
     news/mail readers (like Gnus) blur the distinction between mail
     and news, but there is a difference.  Mail is private.  News is
     public.  Mailing is not posting, and replying is not following up.

"reply"
     Send a mail to the person who has written what you are reading.

"follow up"
     Post an article to the current newsgroup responding to the article
     you are reading.

"backend"
     Gnus gets fed articles from a number of backends, both news and
     mail backends.  Gnus does not handle the underlying media, so to
     speak--this is all done by the backends.

"native"
     Gnus will always use one method (and backend) as the "native", or
     default, way of getting news.

"foreign"
     You can also have any number of foreign groups active at the same
     time.  These are groups that use different backends for getting
     news.

"secondary"
     Secondary backends are somewhere half-way between being native and
     being foreign, but they mostly act like they are native.

"article"
     A message that has been posted as news.

"mail message"
     A message that has been mailed.

"message"
     A mail message or news article

"head"
     The top part of a message, where administrative information (etc.)
     is put.

"body"
     The rest of an article.  Everything that is not in the head is in
     the body.

"header"
     A line from the head of an article.

"headers"
     A collection of such lines, or a collection of heads.  Or even a
     collection of NOV lines.

"NOV"
     When Gnus enters a group, it asks the backend for the headers of
     all unread articles in the group.  Most servers support the News
     OverView format, which is more compact and much faster to read and
     parse than the normal HEAD format.

"level"
     Each group is subscribed at some "level" or other (1-9).  The ones
     that have a lower level are "more" subscribed than the groups with
     a higher level.  In fact, groups on levels 1-5 are considered
     "subscribed"; 6-7 are "unsubscribed"; 8 are "zombies"; and 9 are
     "killed".  Commands for listing groups and scanning for new
     articles will all use the numeric prefix as "working level".

"killed groups"
     No information on killed groups is stored or updated, which makes
     killed groups much easier to handle than subscribed groups.

"zombie groups"
     Just like killed groups, only slightly less dead.

"active file"
     The news server has to keep track of what articles it carries, and
     what groups exist.  All this information in stored in the active
     file, which is rather large, as you might surmise.

"bogus groups"
     A group that exists in the `.newsrc' file, but isn't known to the
     server (i.e.,  it isn't in the active file), is a *bogus group*.
     This means that the group probably doesn't exist (any more).

"server"
     A machine than one can connect to and get news (or mail) from.

"select method"
     A structure that specifies the backend, the server and the virtual
     server parameters.

"virtual server"
     A named select method.  Since a select methods defines all there
     is to know about connecting to a (physical) server, taking the
     things as a whole is a virtual server.

"washing"
     Taking a buffer and running it through a filter of some sort.  The
     result will (more often than not) be cleaner and more pleasing
     than the original.

"ephemeral groups"
     Most groups store data on what articles you have read.  "Ephemeral"
     groups are groups that will have no data stored--when you exit the
     group, it'll disappear into the aether.

"solid groups"
     This is the opposite of ephemeral groups.  All groups listed in the
     group buffer are solid groups.

"sparse articles"
     These are article placeholders shown in the summary buffer when
     `gnus-build-sparse-threads' has been switched on.

Customization
=============

   All variables are properly documented elsewhere in this manual.  This
section is designed to give general pointers on how to customize Gnus
for some quite common situations.

* Menu:

* Slow/Expensive Connection:: You run a local Emacs and get the news elsewhere.
* Slow Terminal Connection::  You run a remote Emacs.
* Little Disk Space::         You feel that having large setup files is icky.
* Slow Machine::              You feel like buying a faster machine.


File: gnus,  Node: Slow/Expensive Connection,  Next: Slow Terminal Connection,  Up: Customization

Slow/Expensive NNTP Connection
------------------------------

   If you run Emacs on a machine locally, and get your news from a
machine over some very thin strings, you want to cut down on the amount
of data Gnus has to get from the NNTP server.

`gnus-read-active-file'
     Set this to `nil', which will inhibit Gnus from requesting the
     entire active file from the server.  This file is often v.  large.
     You also have to set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' and
     `gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups' to `nil' to make sure that Gnus
     doesn't suddenly decide to fetch the active file anyway.

`gnus-nov-is-evil'
     This one has to be `nil'.  If not, grabbing article headers from
     the NNTP server will not be very fast.  Not all NNTP servers
     support XOVER; Gnus will detect this by itself.
