Interface
*********

   When a program (or a person) wants to respond to a message - reply,
follow up, forward, cancel - the program (or person) should just put
point in the buffer where the message is and call the required command.
`Message' will then pop up a new `message' mode buffer with appropriate
headers filled out, and the user can edit the message before sending it.

New Mail Message
================

   The `message-mail' command pops up a new message buffer.

   Two optional parameters are accepted: The first will be used as the
`To' header and the second as the `Subject' header.  If these aren't
present, those two headers will be empty.

New News Message
================

   The `message-news' command pops up a new message buffer.

   This function accepts two optional parameters.  The first will be
used as the `Newsgroups' header and the second as the `Subject' header.
If these aren't present, those two headers will be empty.


File: message,  Node: Reply,  Next: Wide Reply,  Prev: New News Message,  Up: Interface

Reply
=====

   The `message-reply' function pops up a message buffer that's a reply
to the message in the current buffer.

   Message uses the normal methods to determine where replies are to go,
but you can change the behavior to suit your needs by fiddling with the
`message-reply-to-function' variable.

   If you want the replies to go to the `Sender' instead of the `From',
you could do something like this:

     (setq message-reply-to-function
           (lambda ()
            (cond ((equal (mail-fetch-field "from") "somebody")
                    (mail-fetch-field "sender"))
                  (t
                   nil))))

   This function will be called narrowed to the head of the article
that is being replied to.

   As you can see, this function should return a string if it has an
opinion as to what the To header should be.  If it does not, it should
just return `nil', and the normal methods for determining the To header
will be used.

   This function can also return a list.  In that case, each list
element should be a cons, where the car should be the name of an header
(eg. `Cc') and the cdr should be the header value (eg.
`larsi@ifi.uio.no').  All these headers will be inserted into the head
of the outgoing mail.


File: message,  Node: Wide Reply,  Next: Followup,  Prev: Reply,  Up: Interface

Wide Reply
==========

   The `message-wide-reply' pops up a message buffer that's a wide
reply to the message in the current buffer.

   Message uses the normal methods to determine where wide replies are
to go, but you can change the behavior to suit your needs by fiddling
with the `message-wide-reply-to-function'.  It is used in the same way
as `message-reply-to-function' (*note Reply::.).

   Addresses that matches the `rmail-dont-reply-to-names' regular
expression will be removed from the `Cc' header.


File: message,  Node: Followup,  Next: Canceling News,  Prev: Wide Reply,  Up: Interface

Followup
========

   The `message-followup' command pops up a message buffer that's a
followup to the message in the current buffer.

   Message uses the normal methods to determine where followups are to
go, but you can change the behavior to suit your needs by fiddling with
the `message-followup-to-function'.  It is used in the same way as
`message-reply-to-function' (*note Reply::.).

   The `message-use-followup-to' variable says what to do about
`Followup-To' headers.  If it is `use', always use the value.  If it is
`ask' (which is the default), ask whether to use the value.  If it is
`t', use the value unless it is `poster'.  If it is `nil', don't use
the value.

Canceling News
==============

   The `message-cancel-news' command cancels the article in the current
buffer.

Superseding
===========

   The `message-supersede' command pops up a message buffer that will
supersede the message in the current buffer.

   Headers matching the `message-ignored-supersedes-headers' are
removed before popping up the new message buffer.  The default is
`^Path:\\|^Date\\|^NNTP-Posting-Host:\\|^Xref:\\|^Lines:\\|^Received:\\|^X-From-Line:\\|Return-Path:'.


File: message,  Node: Forwarding,  Next: Resending,  Prev: Superseding,  Up: Interface

Forwarding
==========

   The `message-forward' command pops up a message buffer to forward
the message in the current buffer.  If given a prefix, forward using
news.

`message-forward-start-separator'
     Delimiter inserted before forwarded messages.  The default is
     `------- Start of forwarded message -------\n'.

`message-forward-end-separator'
     Delimiter inserted after forwarded messages.  The default is
     `------- End of forwarded message -------\n'.

`message-signature-before-forwarded-message'
     If this variable is `t', which it is by default, your personal
     signature will be inserted before the forwarded message.  If not,
     the forwarded message will be inserted first in the new mail.

`message-included-forward-headers'
     Regexp matching header lines to be included in forwarded messages.


File: message,  Node: Resending,  Next: Bouncing,  Prev: Forwarding,  Up: Interface

Resending
=========

   The `message-resend' command will prompt the user for an address and
resend the message in the current buffer to that address.

   Headers the match the `message-ignored-resent-headers' regexp will
be removed before sending the message.  The default is
`^Return-receipt'.


File: message,  Node: Bouncing,  Prev: Resending,  Up: Interface

Bouncing
========

   The `message-bounce' command will, if the current buffer contains a
bounced mail message, pop up a message buffer stripped of the bounce
information.

   Headers that match the `message-ignored-bounced-headers' regexp will
be removed before popping up the buffer.  The default is `^Received:'.

exist, it will be inserted.

`C-c ?'
     Describe the message mode.

`C-c C-f C-t'
     Go to the `To' header (`message-goto-to').

`C-c C-f C-b'
     Go to the `Bcc' header (`message-goto-bcc').

`C-c C-f C-f'
     Go to the `Fcc' header (`message-goto-fcc').

`C-c C-f C-c'
     Go to the `Cc' header (`message-goto-cc').

`C-c C-f C-s'
     Go to the `Subject' header (`message-goto-subject').

     Go to the `Newsgroups' header (`message-goto-newsgroups').

`C-c C-f C-d'
     Go to the `Distribution' header (`message-goto-distribution').

`C-c C-f C-o'
     Go to the `Followup-To' header (`message-goto-followup-to').

`C-c C-f C-k'
     Go to the `Keywords' header (`message-goto-keywords').

`C-c C-f C-u'
     Go to the `Summary' header (`message-goto-summary').


File: message,  Node: Movement,  Next: Insertion,  Prev: Header Commands,  Up: Commands

Movement
========

`C-c C-b'
     Move to the beginning of the body of the message
     (`message-goto-body').

`C-c C-i'
     Move to the signature of the message (`message-goto-signature').


File: message,  Node: Insertion,  Next: Various Commands,  Prev: Movement,  Up: Commands

Insertion
=========

`C-c C-y'
     Yank the message that's being replied to into the message buffer
     (`message-yank-original').

`C-c C-q'
     Fill the yanked message (`message-fill-yanked-message').

`C-c C-w'
     Insert a signature at the end of the buffer
     (`message-insert-signature').

`message-ignored-cited-headers'
     All headers that match this regexp will be removed from yanked
     messages.  The default is `.', which means that all headers will be
     removed.

`message-citation-line-function'
     Function called to insert the citation line.  The default is
     `message-insert-citation-line'.

`message-yank-prefix'
     When you are replying to or following up an article, you normally
     want to quote the person you are answering.  Inserting quoted text
     is done by "yanking", and each quoted line you yank will have
     `message-yank-prefix' prepended to it.  The default is `> '.  If
     it is `nil', just indent the message.

`message-indentation-spaces'
     Number of spaces to indent yanked messages.

`message-cite-function'
     Function for citing an original message.  The default is
     `message-cite-original'.  You can also set it to
     `sc-cite-original' to use Supercite.

`message-indent-citation-function'
     Function for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail buffer.
     This can also be a list of functions.  Each function can find the
     citation between `(point)' and `(mark t)'.  And each function
     should leave point and mark around the citation text as modified.

`message-signature'
     String to be inserted at the end of the message buffer.  If `t'
     (which is the default), the `message-signature-file' file will be
     inserted instead.  If a function, the result from the function
     will be used instead.  If a form, the result from the form will be
     used instead.  If this variable is `nil', no signature will be
     inserted at all.

`message-signature-file'
     File containing the signature to be inserted at the end of the
     buffer.  The default is `~/.signature'.

   Note that RFC1036 says that a signature should be preceded by the
three characters `-- ' on a line by themselves.  This is to make it
easier for the recipient to automatically recognize and process the
signature.  So don't remove those characters, even though you might feel
that they ruin you beautiful design, like, totally.

   Also note that no signature should be more than four lines long.
Including ASCII graphics is an efficient way to get everybody to believe
that you are silly and have nothing important to say.

Various Commands
================

`C-c C-r'
     Caesar rotate (aka. rot13) the current message
     (`message-caesar-buffer-body').  If narrowing is in effect, just
     rotate the visible portion of the buffer.  A numerical prefix says
     how many places to rotate the text.  The default is 13.

`C-c C-t'
     Insert a `To' header that contains the `Reply-To' or `From' header
     of the message you're following up (`message-insert-to').

`C-c C-n'

     `Newsgroups' header of the article you're replying to
     (`message-insert-newsgroups').

`C-c M-r'
     Rename the buffer (`message-rename-buffer').  If given a prefix,
     prompt for a new buffer name.

File: message,  Node: Message Headers,  Next: Mail Headers,  Up: Variables

Message Headers
===============

   Message is quite aggressive on the message generation front.  It has
to be - it's a combined news and mail agent.  To be able to send
combined messages, it has to generate all headers itself to ensure that
mail and news copies of messages look sufficiently similar.

`message-generate-headers-first'
     If non-`nil', generate all headers before starting to compose the
     message.

`message-from-style'
     Specifies how `From' headers should look.  There are four legal
     values:

    `nil'
          Just the address - `king@grassland.com'.

    `parens'
          `king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)'.

    `angles'
          `Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com>'.

    `default'
          Look like `angles' if that doesn't require quoting, and
          `parens' if it does.  If even `parens' requires quoting, use
          `angles' anyway.

`message-deletable-headers'
     Headers in this list that were previously generated by Message
     will be deleted before posting.  Let's say you post an article.
     Then you decide to post it again to some other group, you naughty
     boy, so you jump back to the `*post-buf*' buffer, edit the
     `Newsgroups' line, and ship it off again.  By default, this
     variable makes sure that the old generated `Message-ID' is
     deleted, and a new one generated.  If this isn't done, the entire
     empire would probably crumble, anarchy would prevail, and cats
     would start walking on two legs and rule the world.  Allegedly.

`message-default-headers'
     This string is inserted at the end of the headers in all message
     buffers.


File: message,  Node: Mail Headers,  Next: Mail Variables,  Prev: Message Headers,  Up: Variables

Mail Headers
============

`message-required-mail-headers'
     See *note News Headers::. for the syntax of this variable.  It is
     `(From Date Subject (optional . In-Reply-To) Message-ID Lines
     (optional . X-Mailer))' by default.

`message-ignored-mail-headers'
     Regexp of headers to be removed before mailing.  The default is
     `^Gcc:\\|^Fcc:'.

`message-default-mail-headers'
     This string is inserted at the end of the headers in all message
     buffers that are initialized as mail.


File: message,  Node: Mail Variables,  Next: News Headers,  Prev: Mail Headers,  Up: Variables

Mail Variables
==============

`message-send-mail-function'
     Function used to send the current buffer as mail.  The default is
     `message-send-mail-with-sendmail'.   If you prefer using MH
     instead, set this variable to `message-send-mail-with-mh'.


File: message,  Node: News Headers,  Next: News Variables,  Prev: Mail Variables,  Up: Variables

News Headers
============

   `message-required-news-headers' a list of header symbols.  These
headers will either be automatically generated, or, if that's
impossible, they will be prompted for.  The following symbols are legal:

`From'
     This required header will be filled out with the result of the
     `message-make-from' function, which depends on the
     `message-from-style', `user-full-name', `user-mail-address'
     variables.

`Subject'
     This required header will be prompted for if not present already.

`Newsgroups'
     This required header says which newsgroups the article is to be
     posted to.  If it isn't present already, it will be prompted for.

`Organization'
     This optional header will be filled out depending on the
     `message-user-organization' variable.
     `message-user-organization-file' will be used if that variable is
     `t'.

`Lines'
     This optional header will be computed by Message.

`Message-ID'
     This required header will be generated by Message.  A unique ID
     will be created based on date, time, user name and system name.
     Message will use `mail-host-address' as the fully qualified domain
     name (FQDN) of the machine if that variable is define.  If not, it
     will use `system-name', which doesn't report a FQDN on some
     machines - notably Suns.

`X-Newsreader'
     This optional header will be filled out according to the
     `message-newsreader' local variable.

`X-Mailer'
     This optional header will be filled out according to the
     `message-mailer' local variable, unless there already is an
     `X-Newsreader' header present.

`In-Reply-To'
     This optional header is filled out using the `Date' and `From'
     header of the article being replied.

`Expires'
     This extremely optional header will be inserted according to the
     `message-expires' variable.  It is highly deprecated and shouldn't
     be used unless you know what you're doing.

`Distribution'
     This optional header is filled out according to the
     `message-distribution-function' variable.  It is a deprecated and
     much misunderstood header.

`Path'
     This extremely optional header should probably not ever be used.
     However, some *very* old servers require that this header is
     present.  `message-user-path' further controls how this `Path'
     header is to look.  If is is `nil', the the server name as the
     leaf node.  If is is a string, use the string.  If it is neither a
     string nor `nil', use the user name only.  However, it is highly
     unlikely that you should need to fiddle with this variable at all.

   In addition, you can enter conses into this list.  The car of this
cons should be a symbol.  This symbol's name is the name of the header,
and the cdr can either be a string to be entered verbatim as the value
of this header, or it can be a function to be called.  This function
should return a string to be inserted.  For instance, if you want to
insert `Mime-Version: 1.0', you should enter `(Mime-Version . "1.0")'
into the list.  If you want to insert a funny quote, you could enter
something like `(X-Yow . yow)' into the list.  The function `yow' will
then be called without any arguments.

   If the list contains a cons where the car of the cons is `optional',
the cdr of this cons will only be inserted if it is non-`nil'.

   Other variables for customizing outgoing news articles:

`message-syntax-checks'
     If non-`nil', message will attempt to check the legality of the
     headers, as well as some other stuff, before posting.  You can
     control the granularity of the check by adding or removing
     elements from this list.  Legal elements are:

    `subject-cmsg'
          Check the subject for commands.

    `sender'
          Insert a new `Sender' header if the `From' header looks odd.

    `multiple-headers'
          Check for the existence of multiple equal headers.

    `sendsys'
          Check for the existence of version and sendsys commands.

    `message-id'
          Check whether the `Message-ID' looks ok.

    `from'
          Check whether the `From' header seems nice.

    `long-lines'
          Check for too long lines.

    `control-chars'
          Check for illegal characters.

    `size'
          Check for excessive size.

    `new-text'
          Check whether there is any new text in the messages.

    `signature'
          Check the length of the signature.

    `approved'
          Check whether the article has an `Approved' header, which is
          something only moderators should include.

    `empty'
          Check whether the article is empty.

    `empty-headers'
          Check whether any of the headers are empty.

    `existing-newsgroups'
          Check whether the newsgroups mentioned in the Newsgroups and
          Followup-To headers exist.

    `valid-newsgroups'
          Check whether the `Newsgroups' and `Followup-To' headers are
          valid syntactially.

     All these conditions are checked by default.

`message-ignored-news-headers'
     Regexp of headers to be removed before posting.  The default is
     `^NNTP-Posting-Host:\\|^Xref:\\|^Bcc:\\|^Gcc:\\|^Fcc:'.

`message-default-news-headers'
     This string is inserted at the end of the headers in all message
     buffers that are initialized as news.

Message Buffers
===============

   Message will generate new buffers with unique buffer names when you
request a message buffer.  When you send the message, the buffer isn't
normally killed off.  It's name is changed and a certain number of old
message buffers are kept alive.

`message-generate-new-buffers'
     If non-`nil', generate new buffers.  The default is `t'.  If this
     is a function, call that function with three parameters: The type,
     the to address and the group name.  (Any of these may be `nil'.)
     The function should return the new buffer name.

`message-max-buffers'
     This variable says how many old message buffers to keep.  If there
     are more message buffers than this, the oldest buffer will be
     killed.  The default is 10.  If this variable is `nil', no old
     message buffers will ever be killed.

`message-send-rename-function'
     After sending a message, the buffer is renamed from, for instance,
     `*reply to Lars*' to `*sent reply to Lars*'.  If you don't like
     this, set this variable to a function that renames the buffer in a
     manner you like.  If you don't want to rename the buffer at all,
     you can say:

          (setq message-send-rename-function 'ignore)

`message-kill-buffer-on-exit'
     If non-`nil', kill the buffer immediately on exit.

Message Actions
===============

   When Message is being used from a news/mail reader, the reader is
likely to want to perform some task after the message has been sent.
Perhaps return to the previous window configuration or mark an article
as replied.

   The user may exit from the message buffer in various ways.  The most
common is `C-c C-c', which sends the message and exits.  Other
possibilities are `C-c C-s' which just sends the message, `C-c C-d'
which postpones the message editing and buries the message buffer, and
`C-c C-k' which kills the message buffer.  Each of these actions have
lists associated with them that contains actions to be executed:
`message-send-actions', `message-exit-actions',
`message-postpone-actions', and `message-kill-actions'.

   Message provides a function to interface with these lists:
`message-add-action'.  The first parameter is the action to be added,
and the rest of the arguments are which lists to add this action to.
Here's an example from Gnus:

       (message-add-action
        `(set-window-configuration ,(current-window-configuration))
        'exit 'postpone 'kill)

   This restores the Gnus window configuration when the message buffer
is killed, postponed or exited.

   An "action" can be either a normal function; or a list where the
`car' is a function and the `cdr' is the list of arguments; or a form
to be `eval'ed.
