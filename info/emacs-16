Copying Messages Out to Files
=============================

   These commands copy messages from an Rmail file into another file.

`o FILE RET'
     Append a copy of the current message to the file FILE, using Rmail
     file format by default (`rmail-output-to-rmail-file').

`C-o FILE RET'
     Append a copy of the current message to the file FILE, using
     system inbox file format by default (`rmail-output').

   The commands `o' and `C-o' copy the current message into a specified
file.  This file may be an Rmail file or it may be in system inbox
format; the output commands ascertain the file's format and write the
copied message in that format.

   The `o' and `C-o' commands differ in two ways: each has its own
separate default file name, and each specifies a choice of format to
use when the file does not already exist.  The `o' command uses Rmail
format when it creates a new file, while `C-o' uses system inbox format
for a new file.  The default file name for `o' is the file name used
last with `o', and the default file name for `C-o' is the file name
used last with `C-o'.

   If the output file is an Rmail file currently visited in an Emacs
buffer, the output commands copy the message into that buffer.  It is
up to you to save the buffer eventually in its file.

   You can also output a message to an Rmail file chosen with a menu.
Choose first the menu bar Classify item, then from the Classify menu
choose the Output Rmail Menu item; then choose the Rmail file you want.
This outputs the current message to that file, like the `o' command.
The variables `rmail-secondary-file-directory' and
`rmail-secondary-file-regexp' specify which files to offer in the menu:
the first variable says which directory to find them in; the second
says which files in that directory to offer (all those that match the
regular expression).

   Copying a message gives the original copy of the message the `filed'
attribute, so that `filed' appears in the mode line when such a message
is current.  If you like to keep just a single copy of every mail
message, set the variable `rmail-delete-after-output' to `t'; then the
`o' and `C-o' commands delete the original message after copying it.
(You can undelete the original afterward if you wish.)

   Copying messages into files in system inbox format uses the header
fields that are displayed in Rmail at the time.  Thus, if you use the
`t' command to view the entire header and then copy the message, the
entire header is copied.  *Note Rmail Display::.

   The variable `rmail-output-file-alist' lets you specify intelligent
defaults for the output file, based on the contents of the current
message.  The value should be a list whose elements have this form:

     (REGEXP . NAME-EXP)

If there's a match for REGEXP in the current message, then the default
file name for output is NAME-EXP.  If multiple elements match the
message, the first matching element decides the default file name.  The
subexpression NAME-EXP may be a string constant giving the file name to
use, or more generally it may be any Lisp expression that returns a
file name as a string.  `rmail-output-file-alist' applies to both `o'
and `C-o'.

Labels
======

   Each message can have various "labels" assigned to it as a means of
classification.  Each label has a name; different names are different
labels.  Any given label is either present or absent on a particular
message.  A few label names have standard meanings and are given to
messages automatically by Rmail when appropriate; these special labels
are called "attributes".  All other labels are assigned only by users.

`a LABEL RET'
     Assign the label LABEL to the current message (`rmail-add-label').

`k LABEL RET'
     Remove the label LABEL from the current message
     (`rmail-kill-label').

`C-M-n LABELS RET'
     Move to the next message that has one of the labels LABELS
     (`rmail-next-labeled-message').

`C-M-p LABELS RET'
     Move to the previous message that has one of the labels LABELS
     (`rmail-previous-labeled-message').

`C-M-l LABELS RET'
     Make a summary of all messages containing any of the labels LABELS
     (`rmail-summary-by-labels').

   The `a' (`rmail-add-label') and `k' (`rmail-kill-label') commands
allow you to assign or remove any label on the current message.  If the
LABEL argument is empty, it means to assign or remove the same label
most recently assigned or removed.

   Once you have given messages labels to classify them as you wish,
there are two ways to use the labels: in moving and in summaries.

   The command `C-M-n LABELS RET' (`rmail-next-labeled-message') moves
to the next message that has one of the labels LABELS.  The argument
LABELS specifies one or more label names, separated by commas.  `C-M-p'
(`rmail-previous-labeled-message') is similar, but moves backwards to
previous messages.  A numeric argument to either command serves as a
repeat count.

   The command `C-M-l LABELS RET' (`rmail-summary-by-labels') displays
a summary containing only the messages that have at least one of a
specified set of labels.  The argument LABELS is one or more label
names, separated by commas.  *Note Rmail Summary::, for information on
summaries.

   If the LABELS argument to `C-M-n', `C-M-p' or `C-M-l' is empty, it
means to use the last set of labels specified for any of these commands.

   Some labels such as `deleted' and `filed' have built-in meanings and
are assigned to or removed from messages automatically at appropriate
times; these labels are called "attributes".  Here is a list of Rmail
attributes:

`unseen'
     Means the message has never been current.  Assigned to messages
     when they come from an inbox file, and removed when a message is
     made current.  When you start Rmail, it initially shows the first
     message that has this attribute.

`deleted'
     Means the message is deleted.  Assigned by deletion commands and
     removed by undeletion commands (*note Rmail Deletion::.).

`filed'
     Means the message has been copied to some other file.  Assigned by
     the file output commands (*note Rmail Files::.).

`answered'
     Means you have mailed an answer to the message.  Assigned by the
     `r' command (`rmail-reply').  *Note Rmail Reply::.

`forwarded'
     Means you have forwarded the message.  Assigned by the `f' command
     (`rmail-forward').  *Note Rmail Reply::.

`edited'
     Means you have edited the text of the message within Rmail.  *Note
     Rmail Editing::.

`resent'
     Means you have resent the message.  Assigned by the command `M-x
     rmail-resend'.  *Note Rmail Reply::.

   All other labels are assigned or removed only by the user, and have
no standard meaning.

Sending Replies
===============

   Rmail has several commands that use Mail mode to send outgoing mail.
*Note Sending Mail::, for information on using Mail mode.  What are
documented here are the special commands of Rmail for entering Mail
mode.  Note that the usual keys for sending mail--`C-x m', `C-x 4 m',
and `C-x 5 m'--are available in Rmail mode and work just as they
usually do.

`m'
     Send a message (`rmail-mail').

`c'
     Continue editing already started outgoing message
     (`rmail-continue').

`r'
     Send a reply to the current Rmail message (`rmail-reply').

`f'
     Forward current message to other users (`rmail-forward').

`C-u f'
     Resend the current message to other users (`rmail-resend').

`M-m'
     Try sending a bounced message a second time
     (`rmail-retry-failure').

   The most common reason to send a message while in Rmail is to reply
to the message you are reading.  To do this, type `r' (`rmail-reply').
This displays the `*mail*' buffer in another window, much like `C-x 4
m', but preinitializes the `Subject', `To', `CC' and `In-reply-to'
header fields based on the message you are replying to.  The `To' field
starts out as the address of the person who sent the message you
received, and the `CC' field starts out with all the other recipients
of that message.

   You can exclude certain recipients from being placed automatically in
the `CC', using the variable `rmail-dont-reply-to-names'.  Its value
should be a regular expression (as a string); any recipient that the
regular expression matches, is excluded from the `CC' field.  The
default value matches your own name, and any name starting with
`info-'.  (Those names are excluded because there is a convention of
using them for large mailing lists to broadcast announcements.)

   To omit the `CC' field completely for a particular reply, enter the
reply command with a numeric argument: `C-u r' or `1 r'.

   Once the `*mail*' buffer has been initialized, editing and sending
the mail goes as usual (*note Sending Mail::.).  You can edit the
presupplied header fields if they are not right for you.  You can also
use the commands of Mail mode (*note Mail Mode::.), including `C-c C-y'
which yanks in the message that you are replying to.  You can switch to
the Rmail buffer, select a different message there, switch back, and
yank the new current message.

   Sometimes a message does not reach its destination.  Mailers usually
send the failed message back to you, enclosed in a "failure message".
The Rmail command `M-m' (`rmail-retry-failure') prepares to send the
same message a second time: it sets up a `*mail*' buffer with the same
text and header fields as before.  If you type `C-c C-c' right away,
you send the message again exactly the same as the first time.
Alternatively, you can edit the text or headers and then send it.  The
variable `rmail-retry-ignored-headers', in the same format as
`rmail-ignored-headers' (*note Rmail Display::.), controls which
headers are stripped from the failed message when retrying it; it
defaults to nil.

   Another frequent reason to send mail in Rmail is to "forward" the
current message to other users.  `f' (`rmail-forward') makes this easy
by preinitializing the `*mail*' buffer with the current message as the
text, and a subject designating a forwarded message.  All you have to
do is fill in the recipients and send.  When you forward a message,
recipients get a message which is "from" you, and which has the
original message in its contents.

   Forwarding a message encloses it between two delimiter lines.  It
also modifies every line that starts with a dash, by inserting `- ' at
the start of the line.  When you receive a forwarded message, if it
contains something besides ordinary text--for example, program source
code--you might find it useful to undo that transformation.  You can do
this by selecting the forwarded message and typing `M-x
unforward-rmail-message'.  This command extracts the original forwarded
message, deleting the inserted `- ' strings, and inserts it into the
Rmail file as a separate message immediately following the current one.

   "Resending" is an alternative similar to forwarding; the difference
is that resending sends a message that is "from" the original sender,
just as it reached you--with a few added header fields `Resent-from'
and `Resent-to' to indicate that it came via you.  To resend a message
in Rmail, use `C-u f'.  (`f' runs `rmail-forward', which is programmed
to invoke `rmail-resend' if you provide a numeric argument.)

   The `m' (`rmail-mail') command is used to start editing an outgoing
message that is not a reply.  It leaves the header fields empty.  Its
only difference from `C-x 4 m' is that it makes the Rmail buffer
accessible for `C-c C-y', just as `r' does.  Thus, `m' can be used to
reply to or forward a message; it can do anything `r' or `f' can do.

   The `c' (`rmail-continue') command resumes editing the `*mail*'
buffer, to finish editing an outgoing message you were already
composing, or to alter a message you have sent.

   If you set the variable `rmail-mail-new-frame' to a non-`nil' value,
then all the Rmail commands to start sending a message create a new
frame to edit it in.  This frame is deleted when you send the message,
or when you use the `Don't Send' item in the `Mail' menu.

Summaries
=========

   A "summary" is a buffer containing one line per message to give you
an overview of the mail in an Rmail file.  Each line shows the message
number, the sender, the labels, and the subject.  Almost all Rmail
commands are valid in the summary buffer also; these apply to the
message described by the current line of the summary.  Moving point in
the summary buffer selects messages as you move to their summary lines.

   A summary buffer applies to a single Rmail file only; if you are
editing multiple Rmail files, each one can have its own summary buffer.
The summary buffer name is made by appending `-summary' to the Rmail
buffer's name.  Normally only one summary buffer is displayed at a time.

* Menu:

* Rmail Make Summary::	     Making various sorts of summaries.
* Rmail Summary Edit::	     Manipulating messages from the summary.

Making Summaries
----------------

   Here are the commands to create a summary for the current Rmail file.
Once the Rmail file has a summary buffer, changes in the Rmail file
(such as deleting or expunging messages, and getting new mail)
automatically update the summary.

`h'
`C-M-h'
     Summarize all messages (`rmail-summary').

`l LABELS RET'
`C-M-l LABELS RET'
     Summarize message that have one or more of the specified labels
     (`rmail-summary-by-labels').

`C-M-r RCPTS RET'
     Summarize messages that have one or more of the specified
     recipients (`rmail-summary-by-recipients').

`C-M-t TOPIC RET'
     Summarize messages that have a match for the specified regexp
     TOPIC in their subjects (`rmail-summary-by-topic').

   The `h' or `C-M-h' (`rmail-summary') command fills the summary buffer
for the current Rmail file with a summary of all the messages in the
file.  It then displays and selects the summary buffer in another
window.

   `C-M-l LABELS RET' (`rmail-summary-by-labels') makes a partial
summary mentioning only the messages that have one or more of the
labels LABELS.  LABELS should contain label names separated by commas.

   `C-M-r RCPTS RET' (`rmail-summary-by-recipients') makes a partial
summary mentioning only the messages that have one or more of the
recipients RCPTS.  RCPTS should contain mailing addresses separated by
commas.

   `C-M-t TOPIC RET' (`rmail-summary-by-topic') makes a partial summary
mentioning only the messages whose subjects have a match for the
regular expression TOPIC.

   Note that there is only one summary buffer for any Rmail file;
making one kind of summary discards any previously made summary.

   The variable `rmail-summary-window-size' says how many lines to use
for the summary window.


File: emacs,  Node: Rmail Summary Edit,  Prev: Rmail Make Summary,  Up: Rmail Summary

Editing in Summaries
--------------------

   You can use the Rmail summary buffer to do almost anything you can do
in the Rmail buffer itself.  In fact, once you have a summary buffer,
there's no need to switch back to the Rmail buffer.

   You can select and display various messages in the Rmail buffer, from
the summary buffer, just by moving point in the summary buffer to
different lines.  It doesn't matter what Emacs command you use to move
point; whichever line point is on at the end of the command, that
message is selected in the Rmail buffer.

   Almost all Rmail commands work in the summary buffer as well as in
the Rmail buffer.  Thus, `d' in the summary buffer deletes the current
message, `u' undeletes, and `x' expunges.  `o' and `C-o' output the
current message to a file; `r' starts a reply to it.  You can scroll
the current message while remaining in the summary buffer using SPC and
DEL.

   The Rmail commands to move between messages also work in the summary
buffer, but with a twist: they move through the set of messages included
in the summary.  They also ensure the Rmail buffer appears on the screen
(unlike cursor motion commands, which update the contents of the Rmail
buffer but don't display it in a window unless it already appears).
Here is a list of these commands:

`n'
     Move to next line, skipping lines saying `deleted', and select its
     message.

`p'
     Move to previous line, skipping lines saying `deleted', and select
     its message.

`M-n'
     Move to next line and select its message.

`M-p'
     Move to previous line and select its message.

`>'
     Move to the last line, and select its message.

`<'
     Move to the first line, and select its message.

`M-s PATTERN RET'
     Search through messages for PATTERN starting with the current
     message; select the message found, and move point in the summary
     buffer to that message's line.

   Deletion, undeletion, and getting new mail, and even selection of a
different message all update the summary buffer when you do them in the
Rmail buffer.  If the variable `rmail-redisplay-summary' is non-`nil',
these actions also bring the summary buffer back onto the screen.

   When you are finished using the summary, type `w'
(`rmail-summary-wipe') to delete the summary buffer's window.  You can
also exit Rmail while in the summary: `q' (`rmail-summary-quit')
deletes the summary window, then exits from Rmail by saving the Rmail
file and switching to another buffer.

Sorting the Rmail File
======================

`M-x rmail-sort-by-date'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by date.

`M-x rmail-sort-by-subject'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by subject.

`M-x rmail-sort-by-author'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by author's name.

`M-x rmail-sort-by-recipient'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by recipient's names.

`M-x rmail-sort-by-correspondent'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by the name of the other
     correspondent.

`M-x rmail-sort-by-lines'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by size (number of lines).

`M-x rmail-sort-by-keywords RET LABELS RET'
     Sort messages of current Rmail file by labels.  The argument
     LABELS should be a comma-separated list of labels.  The order of
     these labels specifies the order of messages; messages with the
     first label come first, messages with the second label come
     second, and so on.  Messages which have none of these labels come
     last.

   The Rmail sort commands perform a *stable sort*: if there is no
reason to prefer either one of two messages, their order remains
unchanged.  You can use this to sort by more than one criterion.  For
example, if you use `rmail-sort-by-date' and then
`rmail-sort-by-author', messages from the same author appear in order
by date.

   With a numeric argument, all these commands reverse the order of
comparison.  This means they sort messages from newest to oldest, from
biggest to smallest, or in reverse alphabetical order.


File: emacs,  Node: Rmail Display,  Next: Rmail Editing,  Prev: Rmail Sorting,  Up: Rmail

Display of Messages
===================

   Rmail reformats the header of each message before displaying it for
the first time.  Reformatting hides uninteresting header fields to
reduce clutter.  You can use the `t' command to show the entire header
or to repeat the header reformatting operation.

`t'
     Toggle display of complete header (`rmail-toggle-header').

   Reformatting the header involves deleting most header fields, on the
grounds that they are not interesting.  The variable
`rmail-ignored-headers' holds a regular expression that specifies which
header fields to hide in this way--if it matches the beginning of a
header field, that whole field is hidden.

   Rmail saves the complete original header before reformatting; to see
it, use the `t' command (`rmail-toggle-header').  This discards the
reformatted headers of the current message and displays it with the
original header.  Repeating `t' reformats the message again.  Selecting
the message again also reformats.

   One consequence of this is that if you edit the reformatted header
(using `e'; *note Rmail Editing::.), subsequent use of `t' will discard
your edits.  On the other hand, if you use `e' after `t', to edit the
original (unreformatted) header, those changes are permanent.

   When used with a window system that supports multiple fonts, Rmail
highlights certain header fields that are especially interesting--by
default, the `From' and `Subject' fields.  The variable
`rmail-highlighted-headers' holds a regular expression that specifies
the header fields to highlight; if it matches the beginning of a header
field, that whole field is highlighted.

   If you specify unusual colors for your text foreground and
background, the colors used for highlighting may not go well with them.
If so, specify different colors for the `highlight' face.  That is
worth doing because the `highlight' face is used for other kinds of
highlighting as well.  *Note Faces::, for how to do this.

   To turn off highlighting entirely in Rmail, set
`rmail-highlighted-headers' to `nil'.

Editing Within a Message
========================

   Most of the usual Emacs commands are available in Rmail mode, though
a few, such as `C-M-n' and `C-M-h', are redefined by Rmail for other
purposes.  However, the Rmail buffer is normally read only, and most of
the letters are redefined as Rmail commands.  If you want to edit the
text of a message, you must use the Rmail command `e'.

`e'
     Edit the current message as ordinary text.

   The `e' command (`rmail-edit-current-message') switches from Rmail
mode into Rmail Edit mode, another major mode which is nearly the same
as Text mode.  The mode line indicates this change.

   In Rmail Edit mode, letters insert themselves as usual and the Rmail
commands are not available.  When you are finished editing the message
and are ready to go back to Rmail, type `C-c C-c', which switches back
to Rmail mode.  Alternatively, you can return to Rmail mode but cancel
all the editing that you have done, by typing `C-c C-]'.

   Entering Rmail Edit mode runs the hook `text-mode-hook'; then it
runs the hook `rmail-edit-mode-hook' (*note Hooks::.).  It adds the
attribute `edited' to the message.

Digest Messages
===============

   A "digest message" is a message which exists to contain and carry
several other messages.  Digests are used on some moderated mailing
lists; all the messages that arrive for the list during a period of time
such as one day are put inside a single digest which is then sent to the
subscribers.  Transmitting the single digest uses much less computer
time than transmitting the individual messages even though the total
size is the same, because the per-message overhead in network mail
transmission is considerable.

   When you receive a digest message, the most convenient way to read
it is to "undigestify" it: to turn it back into many individual
messages.  Then you can read and delete the individual messages as it
suits you.

   To do this, select the digest message and type the command `M-x
undigestify-rmail-message'.  This extracts the submessages as separate
Rmail messages, and inserts them following the digest.  The digest
message itself is flagged as deleted.

Converting an Rmail File to Inbox Format
========================================

   The command `M-x unrmail' converts a file in Rmail format to inbox
format (also known as the system mailbox format), so that you can use it
with other mail-editing tools.  You must specify two arguments, the name
of the Rmail file and the name to use for the converted file.  `M-x
unrmail' does not alter the Rmail file itself.


File: emacs,  Node: Rmail Rot13,  Prev: Out of Rmail,  Up: Rmail

Reading Rot13 Messages
======================

   Mailing list messages that might offend some readers are sometimes
encoded in a simple code called "rot13"--so named because it rotates
the alphabet by 13 letters.  This code is not for secrecy, as it
provides none; rather, it enables those who might be offended to avoid
ever seeing the real text of the message.

   To view a buffer using the rot13 code, use the command `M-x
rot13-other-window'.  This displays the current buffer in another window
which applies the code when displaying the text.

Dired, the Directory Editor
***************************

   Dired makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of a directory, and
optionally some of its subdirectories as well.  You can use the normal
Emacs commands to move around in this buffer, and special Dired commands
to operate on the files listed.

Entering Dired
==============

   To invoke Dired, do `C-x d' or `M-x dired'.  The command reads a
directory name or wildcard file name pattern as a minibuffer argument
to specify which files to list.  Where `dired' differs from
`list-directory' is in putting the buffer into Dired mode so that the
special commands of Dired are available.

   The variable `dired-listing-switches' specifies the options to give
to `ls' for listing directory; this string *must* contain `-l'.  If you
use a numeric prefix argument with the `dired' command, you can specify
the `ls' switches with the minibuffer after you finish entering the
directory specification.

   To display the Dired buffer in another window rather than in the
selected window, use `C-x 4 d' (`dired-other-window)' instead of `C-x
d'.  `C-x 5 d' (`dired-other-frame') uses a separate frame to display
the Dired buffer.

Commands in the Dired Buffer
============================

   The Dired buffer is "read-only", and inserting text in it is not
useful, so ordinary printing characters such as `d' and `x' are used
for special Dired commands.  Some Dired commands "mark" or "flag" the
"current file" (that is, the file on the current line); other commands
operate on the marked files or on the flagged files.

   All the usual Emacs cursor motion commands are available in Dired
buffers.  Some special purpose cursor motion commands are also
provided.  The keys `C-n' and `C-p' are redefined to put the cursor at
the beginning of the file name on the line, rather than at the
beginning of the line.

   For extra convenience, SPC and `n' in Dired are equivalent to `C-n'.
`p' is equivalent to `C-p'.  (Moving by lines is so common in Dired
that it deserves to be easy to type.)  DEL (move up and unflag) is
often useful simply for moving up.

Deleting Files with Dired
=========================

   The primary use of Dired is to "flag" files for deletion and then
delete the files previously flagged.

`d'
     Flag this file for deletion.

`u'
     Remove deletion flag on this line.

`DEL'
     Move point to previous line and remove the deletion flag on that
     line.

`x'
     Delete the files that are flagged for deletion.

   You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing the
file and typing `d'.  The deletion flag is visible as a `D' at the
beginning of the line.  This command moves point to the next line, so
that repeated `d' commands flag successive files.  A numeric argument
serves as a repeat count.

   The files are flagged for deletion rather than deleted immediately to
reduce the danger of deleting a file accidentally.  Until you direct
Dired to expunge the flagged files, you can remove deletion flags using
the commands `u' and DEL.  `u' works just like `d', but removes flags
rather than making flags.  DEL moves upward, removing flags; it is like
`u' with numeric argument automatically negated.

   To delete the flagged files, type `x' (`dired-expunge').  This
command first displays a list of all the file names flagged for
deletion, and requests confirmation with `yes'.  If you confirm, Dired
deletes the flagged files, then deletes their lines from the text of
the Dired buffer.  The shortened Dired buffer remains selected.

   If you answer `no' or quit with `C-g' when asked to confirm, you
return immediately to Dired, with the deletion flags still present in
the buffer, and no files actually deleted.


File: emacs,  Node: Flagging Many Files,  Next: Dired Visiting,  Prev: Dired Deletion,  Up: Dired

Flagging Many Files
===================

`#'
     Flag all auto-save files (files whose names start and end with `#')
     for deletion (*note Auto Save::.).

`~'
     Flag all backup files (files whose names end with `~') for deletion
     (*note Backup::.).

`. (Period)'
     Flag excess numeric backup files for deletion.  The oldest and
     newest few backup files of any one file are exempt; the middle
     ones are flagged.

`% d REGEXP RET'
     Flag for deletion all files whose names match the regular
     expression REGEXP (`dired-flag-files-regexp').

   The `#', `~' and `.' commands flag many files for deletion, based on
their file names.  These commands are useful precisely because they do
not actually delete any files; you can remove the deletion flags from
any flagged files that you really wish to keep.

   `#' flags for deletion all files whose names look like auto-save
files (*note Auto Save::.)--that is, files whose names begin and end
with `#'.  `~' flags for deletion all files whose names say they are
backup files (*note Backup::.)--that is, whose names end in `~'.

   `.' (Period) flags just some of the backup files for deletion: all
but the oldest few and newest few backups of any one file.  Normally
`dired-kept-versions' (*not* `kept-new-versions'; that applies only
when saving) specifies the number of newest versions of each file to
keep, and `kept-old-versions' specifies the number of oldest versions
to keep.

   Period with a positive numeric argument, as in `C-u 3 .', specifies
the number of newest versions to keep, overriding
`dired-kept-versions'.  A negative numeric argument overrides
`kept-old-versions', using minus the value of the argument to specify
the number of oldest versions of each file to keep.

   The `% d' command flags all files whose names match a specified
regular expression (`dired-flag-files-regexp').  Only the non-directory
part of the file name is used in matching.  You can use `^' and `$' to
anchor matches.  You can exclude subdirectories by hiding them (*note
Hiding Subdirectories::.).

Visiting Files in Dired
=======================

   There are several Dired commands for visiting or examining the files
listed in the Dired buffer.  All of them apply to the current line's
file; if that file is really a directory, these commands invoke Dired on
that subdirectory (making a separate Dired buffer).

`f'
     Visit the file described on the current line, like typing `C-x C-f'
     and supplying that file name (`dired-find-file').  *Note
     Visiting::.

`RET'
     Equivalent to `f'.

`o'
     Like `f', but uses another window to display the file's buffer
     (`dired-find-file-other-window').  The Dired buffer remains visible
     in the first window.  This is like using `C-x 4 C-f' to visit the
     file.  *Note Windows::.

`C-o'
     Visit the file described on the current line, and display the
     buffer in another window, but do not select that window
     (`dired-display-file').

`Mouse-2'
     Visit the file named by the line you click on
     (`dired-mouse-find-file-other-window').  This uses another window
     to display the file, like the `o' command.

`v'
     View the file described on the current line, using `M-x view-file'
     (`dired-view-file').

     Viewing a file is like visiting it, but is slanted toward moving
     around in the file conveniently and does not allow changing the
     file.  *Note View File: Misc File Ops.

Dired Marks vs. Flags
=====================

   Instead of flagging a file with `D', you can "mark" the file with
some other character (usually `*').  Most Dired commands to operate on
files, aside from "expunge" (`x'), look for files marked with `*'.

   Here are some commands for marking with `*' (and also for
unmarking).  (*Note Dired Deletion::, for commands to flag and unflag
files.)

`m'
     Mark the current file with `*' (`dired-mark').  With a numeric
     argument N, mark the next N files starting with the current file.
     (If N is negative, mark the previous -N files.)

`*'
     Mark all executable files with `*' (`dired-mark-executables').
     With a numeric argument, unmark all those files.

`@'
     Mark all symbolic links with `*' (`dired-mark-symlinks').  With a
     numeric argument, unmark all those files.

`/'
     Mark with `*' all files which are actually directories, except for
     `.' and `..' (`dired-mark-directories').  With a numeric argument,
     unmark all those files.

`M-DEL MARKCHAR'
     Remove all marks that use the character MARKCHAR
     (`dired-unmark-all-files').  If you specify RET as MARKCHAR, this
     command removes all marks, no matter what the marker character is.

     With a numeric argument, this command queries about each marked
     file, asking whether to remove its mark.  You can answer `y'
     meaning yes, `n' meaning no, `!' to remove the marks from the
     remaining files without asking about them.

`c OLD NEW'
     Replace all marks that use the character OLD with marks that use
     the character NEW (`dired-change-marks').  This command is the
     primary way to create or use marks other than `*' or `D'.  The
     arguments are single characters--do not use RET to terminate them.

     You can use almost any character as a mark character by means of
     this command, to distinguish various classes of files.  If OLD is a
     space (` '), then the command operates on all unmarked files; if
     NEW is a space, then the command unmarks the files it acts on.

     To illustrate the power of this command, here is how to put `*'
     marks on all the files that are unmarked, while unmarking all
     those that have `*' marks:

          c * t  c SPC *  c t SPC

`% m REGEXP RET'
     Mark (with `*') all files whose names match the regular expression
     REGEXP (`dired-mark-files-regexp').  `% m' is like `% d', except
     that it marks files with `*' instead of flagging with `D'.  *Note
     Flagging Many Files::.

     Only the non-directory part of the file name is used in matching.
     Use `^' and `$' to anchor matches.  Exclude subdirectories by
     hiding them (*note Hiding Subdirectories::.).

Operating on Files
==================

   This section describes the basic Dired commands to operate on one
file or several files.  All of these commands are capital letters; all
of them use the minibuffer, either to read an argument or to ask for
confirmation, before they act.  All use the following convention to
decide which files to manipulate:

   * If you give the command a numeric prefix argument N, it operates
     on the next N files, starting with the current file.  (If N is
     negative, the command operates on the -N files preceding the
     current line.)

   * Otherwise, if some files are marked with `*', the command operates
     on all those files.

   * Otherwise, the command operates on the current file only.

   Here are the file-manipulating commands that operate on files in this
way.  (Some other Dired commands, such as `!' and the `%' commands,
also use these conventions to decide which files to work on.)

`C NEW RET'
     Copy the specified files (`dired-do-copy').  The argument NEW is
     the directory to copy into, or (if copying a single file) the new
     name.

     If `dired-copy-preserve-time' is non-`nil', then copying with this
     command sets the modification time of the new file to be the same
     as that of the old file.

`R NEW RET'
     Rename the specified files (`dired-do-rename').  The argument NEW
     is the directory to rename into, or (if renaming a single file)
     the new name.

     Dired automatically changes the visited file name of buffers
     associated with renamed files so that they refer to the new names.

`H NEW RET'
     Make hard links to the specified files (`dired-do-hardlink').  The
     argument NEW is the directory to make the links in, or (if making
     just one link) the name to give the link.

`S NEW RET'
     Make symbolic links to the specified files (`dired-do-symlink').
     The argument NEW is the directory to make the links in, or (if
     making just one link) the name to give the link.

`M MODESPEC RET'
     Change the mode (also called "permission bits") of the specified
     files (`dired-do-chmod').  This uses the `chmod' program, so
     MODESPEC can be any argument that `chmod' can handle.

`G NEWGROUP RET'
     Change the group of the specified files to NEWGROUP
     (`dired-do-chgrp').

`O NEWOWNER RET'
     Change the owner of the specified files to NEWOWNER
     (`dired-do-chown').  (On most systems, only the superuser can do
     this.)

     The variable `dired-chown-program' specifies the name of the
     program to use to do the work (different systems put `chown' in
     different places).

`P COMMAND RET'
     Print the specified files (`dired-do-print').  You must specify the
     command to print them with, but the minibuffer starts out with a
     suitable guess made using the variables `lpr-command' and
     `lpr-switches' (the same variables that `lpr-file' uses; *note
     Hardcopy::.).

`Z'
     Compress or uncompress the specified files (`dired-do-compress').
     If the file appears to be a compressed file, it is uncompressed;
     otherwise, it is compressed.

`L'
     Load the specified Emacs Lisp files (`dired-do-load').  *Note Lisp
     Libraries::.

`B'
     Byte compile the specified Emacs Lisp files
     (`dired-do-byte-compile').  *Note Byte Compilation: (elisp)Byte
     Compilation.

`A REGEXP RET'
     Search all the specified files for the regular expression REGEXP
     (`dired-do-search').

     This command is a variant of `tags-search'.  The search stops at
     the first match it finds; use `M-,' to resume the search and find
     the next match.  *Note Tags Search::.

`Q FROM RET TO RET'
     Perform `query-replace-regexp' on each of the specified files,
     replacing matches for FROM (a regular expression) with the string
     TO (`dired-do-query-replace').

     This command is a variant of `tags-query-replace'.  If you exit the
     query replace loop, you can use `M-,' to resume the scan and
     replace more matches.  *Note Tags Search::.

   One special file-operation command is `+'
(`dired-create-directory').  This command reads a directory name and
creates the directory if it does not already exist.

Shell Commands in Dired
=======================

   The dired command `!' (`dired-do-shell-command') reads a shell
command string in the minibuffer and runs that shell command on all the
specified files.  There are two ways of applying a shell command to
multiple files:

   * If you use `*' in the shell command, then it runs just once, with
     the list of file names substituted for the `*'.  The order of file
     names is the order of appearance in the Dired buffer.

     Thus, `! tar cf foo.tar * RET' runs `tar' on the entire list of
     file names, putting them into one tar file `foo.tar'.

   * If the command string doesn't contain `*', then it runs once *for
     each file*, with the file name added at the end.

     For example, `! uudecode RET' runs `uudecode' on each file.

   What if you want to run the shell command once for each file but with
the file name inserted in the middle?  Or if you want to use the file
names in a more complicated fashion?  Use a shell loop.  For example,
this shell command would run `uuencode' on each of the specified files,
writing the output into a corresponding `.uu' file:

     for file in *; uuencode $file $file >$file.uu; done

   The working directory for the shell command is the top level
directory of the Dired buffer.

   The `!' command does not attempt to update the Dired buffer to show
new or modified files, because it doesn't really understand shell
commands, and does not know what files the shell command changed.  Use
the `g' command to update the Dired buffer (*note Dired Updating::.).


File: emacs,  Node: Transforming File Names,  Next: Comparison in Dired,  Prev: Shell Commands in Dired,  Up: Dired

Transforming File Names in Dired
================================

   Here are commands that alter file names in a systematic way:

`% u'
     Rename each of the selected files to an upper case name
     (`dired-upcase').  If the old file names are `Foo' and `bar', the
     new names are `FOO' and `BAR'.

`% l'
     Rename each of the selected files to a lower case name
     (`dired-downcase').  If the old file names are `Foo' and `bar',
     the new names are `foo' and `bar'.

`% R FROM RET TO RET'
`% C FROM RET TO RET'
`% H FROM RET TO RET'
`% S FROM RET TO RET'
     These four commands rename, copy, make hard links and make soft
     links, in each case computing the new name by regular expression
     substitution from the name of the old file.

   The four regular expression substitution commands effectively perform
a search-and-replace on the selected file names in the Dired buffer.
They read two arguments: a regular expression FROM, and a substitution
pattern TO.

   The commands match each "old" file name against the regular
expression FROM, and then replace the matching part with TO.  You can
use `\&' and `\DIGIT' in TO to refer to all or part of what the pattern
matched in the old file name, as in `query-replace-regexp' (*note Query
Replace::.).  If the regular expression matches more than once in a
file name, only the first match is replaced.

   For example, `% R ^.*$ RET x-\& RET' renames each selected file by
prepending `x-' to its name.  The inverse of this, removing `x-' from
the front of each file name, is also possible: one method is `% R
^x-\(.*\)$ RET \1 RET'; another is `% R ^x- RET RET'.  (Use `^' and `$'
to anchor matches that should span the whole filename.)

   Normally, the replacement process does not consider the files'
directory names; it operates on the file name within the directory.  If
you specify a numeric argument of zero, then replacement affects the
entire absolute file name including directory name.

   Often you will want to apply the command to all files matching the
same REGEXP that you use in the command.  To do this, mark those files
with `% m REGEXP RET', then use the same regular expression in the
command to operate on the files.  To make this easier, the `%' commands
to operate on files use the last regular expression specified in any
`%' command as a default.


File: emacs,  Node: Comparison in Dired,  Next: Subdirectories in Dired,  Prev: Transforming File Names,  Up: Dired

File Comparison with Dired
==========================

   Here are two Dired commands that compare specified files using
`diff'.

`='
     Compare the current file (the file at point) with another file
     (the file at the mark) using the `diff' program (`dired-diff').
     The file at the mark is the first argument of `diff', and the file
     at point is the second argument.

`M-='
     Compare the current file with its latest backup file
     (`dired-backup-diff').  If the current file is itself a backup,
     compare it with the file it is a backup of; this way, you can
     compare a file with any backup version of your choice.

     The backup file is the first file given to `diff'.


File: emacs,  Node: Subdirectories in Dired,  Next: Subdirectory Motion,  Prev: Comparison in Dired,  Up: Dired

Subdirectories in Dired
=======================

   A Dired buffer displays just one directory in the normal case; but
you can optionally include its subdirectories as well.

   The simplest way to include multiple directories in one Dired buffer
is to specify the options `-lR' for running `ls'.  (If you give a
numeric argument when you run Dired, then you can specify these options
in the minibuffer.)  That produces a recursive directory listing showing
all subdirectories at all levels.

   But usually all the subdirectories are too many; usually you will
prefer to include specific subdirectories only.  You can do this with
the `i' command:

`i'
     Insert the contents of a subdirectory later in the buffer.

   Use the `i' (`dired-maybe-insert-subdir') command on a line that
describes a file which is a directory.  It inserts the contents of that
directory into the same Dired buffer, and moves there.  Inserted
subdirectory contents follow the top-level directory of the Dired
buffer, just as they do in `ls -lR' output.

   If the subdirectory's contents are already present in the buffer, the
`i' command just moves to it.

   In either case, `i' sets the Emacs mark before moving, so `C-u
C-SPC' takes you back to the old position in the buffer (the line
describing that subdirectory).

   Use the `l' command (`dired-do-redisplay') to update the
subdirectory's contents.  Use `k' to delete the subdirectory.  *Note
Dired Updating::.


File: emacs,  Node: Subdirectory Motion,  Next: Hiding Subdirectories,  Prev: Subdirectories in Dired,  Up: Dired

Moving Over Subdirectories
==========================

   When a Dired buffer lists subdirectories, you can use the page motion
commands `C-x [' and `C-x ]' to move by entire directories.

   The following commands move across, up and down in the tree of
directories within one Dired buffer.  They move to "directory header
lines", which are the lines that give a directory's name, at the
beginning of the directory's contents.

`C-M-n'
     Go to next subdirectory header line, regardless of level
     (`dired-next-subdir').

`C-M-p'
     Go to previous subdirectory header line, regardless of level
     (`dired-prev-subdir').

`C-M-u'
     Go up to the parent directory's header line (`dired-tree-up').

`C-M-d'
     Go down in the directory tree, to the first subdirectory's header
     line (`dired-tree-down').


File: emacs,  Node: Hiding Subdirectories,  Next: Dired Updating,  Prev: Subdirectory Motion,  Up: Dired

Hiding Subdirectories
=====================

   "Hiding" a subdirectory means to make it invisible, except for its
header line, via selective display (*note Selective Display::.).

`$'
     Hide or reveal the subdirectory that point is in, and move point
     to the next subdirectory (`dired-hide-subdir').  A numeric
     argument serves as a repeat count.

`M-$'
     Hide all subdirectories in this Dired buffer, leaving only their
     header lines (`dired-hide-all').  Or, if any subdirectory is
     currently hidden, make all subdirectories visible again.  You can
     use this command to get an overview in very deep directory trees
     or to move quickly to subdirectories far away.

   Ordinary Dired commands never consider files inside a hidden
subdirectory.  For example, the commands to operate on marked files
ignore files in hidden directories even if they are marked.  Thus you
can use hiding to temporarily exclude subdirectories from operations
without having to remove the markers.

   The subdirectory hiding commands toggle; that is, they hide what was
visible, and show what was hidden.
