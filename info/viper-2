File: viper,  Node: New Commands,  Next: Useful Packages,  Prev: Movement and Markers,  Up: Improvements over Vi

New Commands
============

   These commands have no Vi analogs.

`C-x, C-c'
     `C-x' will exit from Vi state and return to Emacs state
     *temporarily*. If you hit one of these keys, Emacs will believe
     that you hit that key in Emacs state. For example, if you hit `C-x'
     followed by `2', then the current window will be split into 2 and
     you will be in Vi state again. Except for novice users, `C-c' is
     also set to temporarily escape to Emacs and execute a command from
     the current major mode.  `ESC' will do the same, if you configure
     ESC as Meta by setting `vip-no-multiple-ESC' to nil in `.vip'.
     *Note Customization::. `C-z' in Insert state will make Emacs think
     `Meta' has been hit.

`\'
     Escape to Emacs to execute a single Emacs command. For instance, `\
     ESC' will act like a Meta key.

`Q'
     `Q' is for query replace.  By default, each string to be replaced
     is treated as a regular expression. You can use `(setq
     vip-re-query-replace nil)' in your `.emacs' file to turn this off.
     (For normal searches, `:se nomagic' will work. Note that `:se
     nomagic' turns Regexps off completely, unlike Vi).

`v'
`V'
`C-v'
     These keys are used to visit files.  `v' will switch to a buffer
     visiting file whose name can be entered in the Minibuffer. `V' is
     similar, but will use a window different from the current window.
     `C-v' is like `V', except that a new frame (X window) will be used
     instead of a new Emacs window.

`#'
     If followed by a certain character CH, it becomes an operator whose
     argument is the region determined by the motion command that
     follows (indicated as <move>).  Currently, CH can be one of `c',
     `C', `g', `q', and `s'. For instance, `#qr' will prompt you for a
     string and then prepend this string to each line in the buffer.

`# c'
     Change upper case characters in the region to lower case
     (`downcase-region').  Emacs command `M-l' does the same for words.

`# C'
     Change lower case characters in the region to upper case. For
     instance, `# C 3 w' will capitalize 3 words from the current point
     (`upcase-region').  Emacs command `M-u' does the same for words.

`# g'
     Execute last keyboard macro for each line in the region
     (`vip-global-execute').

`# q'
     Insert specified string at the beginning of each line in the region
     (`vip-quote-region').

`# s'
     Check spelling of words in the region (`spell-region').  The
     function used for spelling is determined from the variable
     `vip-spell-function'.

`*'
     Call last keyboard macro.

`m .'
     Set mark at point and push old mark off the ring

`m<'
`m>'
     Set mark at beginning and end of buffer, respectively.

`m,'
     Jump to mark and pop mark off the ring. *Note Mark: (emacs)Mark,
     for more info.

`] register'
     View contents of register

`[ textmarker'
     View filename and position of textmarker

`@#'
`@register'
`@!'
     Begin/end keyboard macro. @register has a different meaning when
     used after a `@#'. *Note Macros and Registers::, for details

`[]'
     Go to end of heading.

`g <*movement command*>'
     Search buffer for text delimited by movement command. The canonical
     example is `gw' to search for the word under the cursor.  *Note
     Improved Search::, for details.

`_'
     Meta key when in Vi state.*Note Vi State::, for an explanation.

`C-g and C-]'
     Quit and Abort Recursive edit. These may be necessary on occasion.
     *Note Vi State::, for a reason.

`C-c g'
     Hitting `C-c' followed by `g' will display the information on the
     current buffer. This is the same as hitting  `C-g' in Vi, but, as
     explained above, `C-g' is needed for other purposes in Emacs.

`C-c /'
     Without a prefix argument, this command toggles
     case-sensitive/case-insensitive search modes and plain
     vanilla/regular expression search. With the prefix argument 1,
     i.e., `1 C-c /', this toggles case-sensitivity; with the prefix
     argument 2, toggles plain vanilla search and search using regular
     expressions. *Note Viper Specials::, for alternative ways to invoke
     this function.

`M-p and M-n'
     In the Minibuffer, these commands navigate through the minibuffer
     histories, such as the history of search strings, Ex commands, etc.

`C-c M-p and C-c M-n'
     In Insert or Replace state, these commands let  the user peruse
     the history of insertion strings used in previous insert or replace
     commands. Try to hit `C-c M-p' or `C-c M-n' repeatedly and see what
     happens. *Note Viper Specials::, for more.

     In Vi state, these commands let the user peruse the history of
     Vi-style destructive commands, such as `dw', `J', `a', etc.  By
     repeatedly typing `C-c M-p' or `C-c M-n' you will cycle Viper
     through the recent history of Vi commands, displaying the commands
     one by one. Once an appropriate command is found, it can be
     executed by typing ``.''.

     Since typing `C-c M-p' is tedious, it is more convenient to bind an
     appropriate function to a function key on the keyboard and use
     that key.  *Note Viper Specials::, for details.

`Ex commands'
     The commands `:args', `:next', `:pre' behave differently. `:pwd'
     exists to get current directory.  The commands `:b' and `:B'
     switch buffers around. *Note File and Buffer Handling::, for
     details.  There are also the new commands `:RelatedFile' and
     `PreviousRelatedFile' (which abbreviate to `R' and `P',
     respectively. *Note Viper Specials::, for details.

   Apart from the new commands, many old commands have been enhanced.
Most notably, Vi style macros are much more powerful in Viper than in
Vi. *Note Vi Macros::, for details.

Useful Packages
===============

   Some Emacs packages are mentioned here as an aid to the new Viper
user, to indicate what Viper is capable of.  A vast number comes with
the standard Emacs distribution, and many more exist on the net and on
the archives.

   This manual also mentions some Emacs features a new user should know
about. The details of these are found in the GNU Emacs Manual.

   The features first. For details, look up the Emacs Manual.

`Make'
     Makes and Compiles can be done from the editor. Error messages
     will be parsed and you can move to the error lines.

`Shell'
     You can talk to Shells from inside the editor. Your entire shell
     session can be treated as a file.

`Mail'
     Mail can be read from and sent within the editor. Several
     sophisticated packages exist.

`Language Sensitive Editing'
     Editing modes are written for most computer  languages in
     existence. By controlling indentation, they catch punctuation
     errors.

   The packages, below, represents a drop in the sea of special-purpose
packages that come with standard distribution of Emacs 19.

`Transparent FTP'
     `ange-ftp.el' can ftp from the editor to files on other machines
     transparent to the user.

`RCS Interfaces'
     `vc.el' for doing RCS commands from inside the editor

`Directory Editor'
     `dired.el' for editing contents of directories and for navigating
     in the file system.

`Syntactic Highlighting'
     `hilit19.el' and `font-lock.el' for automatic highlighting various
     parts of a buffer using different fonts and colors.

`Saving Emacs Configuration'
     `desktop.el' for saving/restoring configuration on Emacs
     exit/startup.

`Spell Checker'
     `ispell.el' for spell checking the buffer, words, regions, etc.

`File and Buffer Comparison'
     `ediff.el' for finding differences between files and for applying
     patches.

Emacs Lisp archives exist on `archive.cis.ohio-state.edu' and
`wuarchive.wustl.edu'


File: viper,  Node: Customization,  Next: Commands,  Prev: Improvements over Vi,  Up: Top

Customization
*************

   Customization can be done in 2 ways.

   * Elisp code in a `.vip' file in your home directory. Viper loads
     `.vip' just before it does the binding for mode hooks. This is the
     recommended method.

   * Elisp code in your `.emacs' file before and after the `(require
     'viper)' line. This method is not recommended, unless you are know
     what you are doing.

Emacs customization is done in Emacs Lisp. For the common cases,
examples are provided that you can use directly.

* Menu:

* Rudimentary Changes::          Simple constant definitions.
* Keybindings::                  Enabling Emacs Keys, Rebinding keys, etc.
* Packages that Change Keymaps:: How to deal with such beasts.
* Viper Specials::               Special Viper commands.
* Vi Macros::                    How to do Vi style macros.


File: viper,  Node: Rudimentary Changes,  Next: Keybindings,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Customization

Rudimentary Changes
===================

   An easy way to customize Viper is to change the values of constants
used in Viper.  Here is the list of the constants used in Viper and
their default values. The corresponding :se command is also indicated.
(The symbols `t' and `nil' represent "true" and "false" in Lisp).

   Viper supports both the abbreviated Vi variable names and their full
names. Variable completion is done on full names only. `TAB' and `SPC'
complete variable names. Typing `=' will complete the name and then
will prompt for a value, if applicable. For instance, `:se auSPC' will
complete the command to `:set autoindent'; `:se taSPC' will complete
the command and prompt further like this: `:set tabstop = '.  However,
typing `:se tsSPC' will produce a "No match" message because `ts' is an
abbreviation for `tabstop' and Viper supports completion on full names
only. However, you can still hit `RET' or `=', which will complete the
command like this: `:set ts = ' and Viper will be waiting for you to
type a value for the tabstop variable.  To get the full list of Vi
variables, type `:se SPC TAB'.

`vip-auto-indent nil'
`:se ai (:se autoindent)'
`:se gai (:se global-autoindent)'
     If `t', enable auto indentation.  by `RET', `o' or `O' command.

     `vip-auto-indent' is a local variable. To change the value
     globally, use `setq-default'. It may be useful for certain major
     modes to have their own values of `vip-auto-indent'. This can be
     achieved by using `setq' to change the local value of this
     variable in the hooks to the appropriate major modes.

     `:se ai' changes the value of `vip-auto-indent' in the current
     buffer only; `:se gai' does the same globally.

`vip-electric-mode t'
     If `t', auto-indentation becomes electric, which means that `RET',
     `O', and `o' indent cursor according to the current major mode. In
     the future, this variable may control additional electric features.

     This is a local variable: `setq' changes the value of this variable
     in the current buffer only. Use `setq-default' to change the value
     in all buffers.

`vip-case-fold-search nil'
`:se ic (:se ignorecase)'
     If `t', search ignores cases.  This can also be toggled by quickly
     hitting `/' twice.

`vip-re-search nil'
`:se magic'
     If `t' then search is reg-exp search, if `nil' then vanilla search.
     This behavior can also be toggled by quickly hitting `/' trice.

`buffer-read-only'
`:se ro (:se readonly)'
     Set current buffer to read only. To change globally put
     `(setq-default buffer-read-only t)' in your `.emacs' file.

`blink-matching-paren t'
`:se sm (:se showmatch)'
     Show matching parens by blinking cursor.

`tab-width t (default setting via `setq-default')'
`:se ts=value (:se tabstop=value)'
`:se gts=value (:se global-tabstop=value)'
     `tab-width' is a local variable that controls the width of the tab
     stops.  To change the value globally, use `setq-default'; for
     local settings, use `setq'.

     The command `:se ts' sets the tab width in the current buffer
     only; it has no effect on other buffers.

     The command `:se gts' sets tab width globally, for all buffers
     where the tab is not yet set locally, including the new buffers.

     Note that typing `TAB' normally doesn't insert the tab, since this
     key is usually bound to a text-formatting function,
     `indent-for-tab-command' (which facilitates programming and
     document writing). Instead, the tab is inserted via the command
     `vip-insert-tab', which is bound to `S-tab' (shift + tab).

     On some non-windowing terminals, Shift doesn't modify the `TAB'
     key, so `S-tab' behaves as if it were `TAB'. In such a case, you
     will have to bind `vip-insert-tab' to some other convenient key.

`vip-shift-width 8'
`:se sw=value  (:se shiftwidth=value)'
     The number of columns shifted by `>' and `<' commands.

`vip-search-wrap-around t'
`:se ws (:se wrapscan)'
     If `t', search wraps around the end/beginning of buffer.

`vip-tags-file-name "TAGS"'
     The name of the file used as the tag table.

`vip-re-query-replace nil'
     If `t', use reg-exp replace in query replace.

`vip-want-ctl-h-help nil'
     If `t', `C-h' is bound to `help-command'; if `nil', it is bound to
     `delete-backward-char'.

`vip-vi-style-in-minibuffer t'
     If `t', Viper provides a high degree of compatibility with Vi
     insert mode when you type text in the Minibuffer; if `nil', typing
     in the Minibuffer feels like plain Emacs.

`vip-no-multiple-ESC t'
     If you set this to `nil', you can use `ESC' as Meta in Vi state.
     Normally, this is not necessary, since graphical displays have
     separate Meta keys (usually on each side of the space bar). On a
     dumb terminal, Viper sets this variable to `twice', which is
     almost like `nil', except that double `ESC' beeps. This, too, lets
     ESC to be used as a Meta.

`vip-keysequence-delay 140'
     Escape sequences separated by this much delay are interpreted as
     command, ignoring the special meaning of ESC in VI. The default is
     suitable for most terminals. However, if your terminal is
     extremely slow, you might want to increase this slightly. You will
     know if your terminal is slow if the ESC key sequences emitted by
     the arrow keys are interpreted as separately typed characters (and
     thus the arrow keys won't work).  Making this value too large will
     slow you down, so exercise restraint.

`vip-ex-style-motion t'
     Set this to `nil', if you want `l,h' to cross lines, etc. *Note
     Movement and Markers::, for more info.

`vip-ex-style-editing-in-insert t'
     Set this to to `nil', if you want `ESC' to not move back and `C-h'
     to not stop at the beginning of a line in Insert state.

`vip-always t'
     Leave it to Viper to decide when a buffer must be brought up in Vi
     state, Insert state, or Emacs state. This heuristics works well in
     virtually all cases.  This option must be set before Viper is
     loaded or in the `.vip' file.

`vip-custom-file-name "~/.vip"'
     Change this if you want. Must be set in `.emacs' (not `.vip'!)
     before Viper is loaded. Note that you have to set it as a string
     inside double quotes.

`vip-spell-function 'ispell-region'
     Function used by the command `#c<move>' to spell.

`ex-nontrivial-find-file-function'
     The value of this variable is the function used to find all files
     that match a wildcard. This is usually done when the user types
     `:e' and specifies a wildcard in the file name (or if the file
     name contains unusual symbols (e.g., a space). Viper provides two
     functions for this: one for Unix-like systems
     (`vip-ex-nontrivial-find-file-unix') and one for DOS, W95, and NT
     (`vip-ex-nontrivial-find-file-ms'). If the default function
     doesn't quite do what you expect or if you prefer to use "fancy"
     shells, you may have to write your own version of this function
     and make it into the value of `ex-nontrivial-find-file-function'.
     Use `vip-ex-nontrivial-find-file-unix' and
     `vip-ex-nontrivial-find-file-ms' as examples.

`ex-cycle-other-window t'
     If `t', `:n' and `:b' will cycle through files in another window,
     if one exists.

`ex-cycle-through-non-files nil'
     `:n' does not normally cycle through buffers. Set this to get
     buffers also.

`vip-automatic-iso-accents nil'
     If `t', ISO accents will be turned on in insert/replace Viper
     states and turned off in Vi state. This is useful for editing text
     in European languages. This variable is buffer-local. If used, it
     should be set in the hooks to the appropriate major modes (usually
     setting it in `text-mode-hook' is enough).

`vip-want-emacs-keys-in-insert'
     This is set to `nil' for user levels 1 and 2 and to `t' for user
     levels 3 and 4. Users who specify level 5 are allowed to set this
     variable as they please (the default for this level is `t'). If
     set to `nil', complete Vi compatibility is provided in Insert
     state. This is really not recommended, as this precludes you from
     using language-specific features provided by the major modes.

`vip-want-emacs-keys-in-vi'
     This is set to `nil' for user level 1 and to `t' for user levels
     2-4.  At level 5, users are allowed to set this variable as they
     please (the default for this level is `t').  If set to `nil',
     complete Vi compatibility is provided in Vi command state. Setting
     this to `nil' is really a bad idea, unless you are a novice, as
     this precludes the use of language-specific features provided by
     the major modes.

`vip-keep-point-on-repeat t'
     If `t', point is not moved when the user repeats the previous
     command by typing `.'  This is very useful for doing repeated
     changes with the `.' key.

`vip-repeat-from-history-key 'f12'
     Prefix key used to invoke the macros `f12 1' and `f12 2' that
     repeat the second-last and the third-last destructive command.
     Both these macros are bound (as Viper macros) to
     `vip-repeat-from-history', which checks the second key by which it
     is invoked to see which of the previous commands to invoke. Viper
     binds `f12 1' and `f12 2' only, but the user can bind more in
     `~/.vip'. *Note Vi Macros::, for how to do this.

`vip-keep-point-on-undo nil'
     If `t', Viper tries to not move point when undoing commands.
     Instead, it will briefly move the cursor to the place where change
     has taken place. However, if the undone piece of text is not seen
     in window, then point will be moved to the place where the change
     took place.  Set it to `t' and see if you like it better.

`vip-delete-backwards-in-replace nil'
     If `t', DEL key will delete characters while moving the cursor
     backwards.  If `nil', the cursor will move backwards without
     deleting anything.

`vip-replace-overlay-face 'vip-replace-overlay-face'
     On a graphical display, Viper highlights replacement regions
     instead of putting a `$' at the end. This variable controls the so
     called "face" used to highlight the region.

     By default, `vip-replace-overlay-face' underlines the replacement
     on monochrome displays and highlights it with color on  color
     displays.  If you know something about Emacs faces and don't like
     how Viper highlights replacement regions, you can change this
     variable to specify a new face name. (Emacs faces are described in
     the Emacs Lisp reference.) On a color display, the following
     customization method is usually most effective:
          (set-face-foreground vip-replace-overlay-face "DarkSlateBlue")
          (set-face-background vip-replace-overlay-face "yellow")
     For a complete list of colors available to you, evaluate the
     expression `(x-defined-colors)'. (Type it in the buffer `*scratch*'
     and then hit the `C-j' key.

`vip-replace-overlay-cursor-color  "Red"'
     Cursor color when it is inside the replacement region.  This has
     effect only on color displays and only when Emacs runs as an X
     application.

`vip-replace-region-end-delimiter "$"'
     A string used to mark the end of replacement regions.  It is used
     only with TTYs or if `vip-use-replace-region-delimiters' is
     non-nil.

`vip-replace-region-start-delimiter  ""'
     A string used to mark the beginning of replacement regions.  It is
     used only with TTYs or if `vip-use-replace-region-delimiters' is
     non-nil.

`vip-use-replace-region-delimiters'
     If non-nil, Viper will always use
     `vip-replace-region-end-delimiter' and
     `vip-replace-region-start-delimiter' to delimit replacement
     regions, even on color displays (where this is unnecessary). By
     default, this variable is non-nil only on TTYs or monochrome
     displays.

`vip-toggle-key "\C-z"'
     Specifies the key used to switch from Emacs to Vi and back.  Must
     be set in `.vip' or prior to loading Viper. This variable can't be
     changed interactively after Viper is loaded.

`vip-ESC-key "\e"'
     Specifies the key used to escape from Insert/Replace states to Vi.
     Must be set in `.vip' or prior to loading Viper. This variable
     cannot be changed interactively after Viper is loaded.

`vip-buffer-search-char nil'
     Key used for buffer search. *Note Viper Specials::, for details.

`vip-surrounding-word-function 'vip-surrounding-word'
     The value of this variable is a function name that is used to
     determine what constitutes a word clicked upon by the mouse. This
     is used by mouse search and insert.

`vip-search-face 'vip-search-face'
     Variable that controls how search patterns are highlighted when
     they are found.

`vip-vi-state-hook nil'
     List of parameterless functions to be run just after entering the
     Vi command state.

`vip-insert-state-hook nil'
     Same for Insert state. This hook is also run after entering
     Replace state.

`vip-replace-state-hook  nil'
     List of (parameterless) functions called just after entering
     Replace state (and after all `vip-insert-state-hook').

`vip-emacs-state-hook nil'
     List of (parameterless) functions called just after switching from
     Vi state to Emacs state.

`vip-load-hook nil'
     List of (parameterless) functions called just after loading Viper.
     This is the last chance to do customization before Viper is up and
     running.

You can reset some of these constants in Viper with the Ex command
`:set' (when so indicated in the table).  Or you can include a line
like this in your `.vip' file:
     (setq vip-case-fold-search t)

Keybindings
===========

   Viper lets you define hot keys, i.e., you can associate keyboard keys
such as F1, Help, PgDn, etc., with Emacs Lisp functions (that may
already exist or that you will write). Each key has a "preferred form"
in Emacs. For instance, the Up key's preferred form is [up], the Help
key's preferred form is [help], and the Undo key has the preferred form
[f14].  You can find out the preferred form of a key by typing `M-x
describe-key-briefly' and then typing the key you want to know about.

   Under X Windows, every keyboard key emits its preferred form, so you
can just type

     (global-set-key [f11] 'calendar)                        ; L1, Stop
     (global-set-key [f14] 'undo)                            ; L4, Undo

to bind L1 so it will invoke the Emacs Calendar and to bind L4 so it
will undo changes.  However, on a dumb terminal or in an Xterm window,
even the standard arrow keys may not emit the right signals for Emacs
to understand. To let Emacs know about those keys, you will have to
find out which key sequences they emit by typing `C-q' and then the key
(you should switch to Emacs state first). Then you can bind those
sequences to their preferred forms using `function-key-map' as follows:

     (cond ((string= (getenv "TERM") "xterm")
            (define-key function-key-map "\e[192z" [f11])    ; L1
            (define-key function-key-map "\e[195z" [f14])    ; L4, Undo

   The above illustrates how to do this for Xterm. On VT100, you would
have to replace "xterm" with "vt100" and also change the key sequences
(the same key may emit different sequences on different types of
terminals).

   The above keys are global, so they are overwritten by the local maps
defined by the major modes and by Viper itself. Therefore, if you wish
to change a binding set by a major mode or by Viper, read this.

   Viper users who wish to specify their own key bindings should be
concerned only with the following three keymaps:
`vip-vi-global-user-map' for Vi state commands,
`vip-insert-global-user-map' for Insert state commands, and
`vip-emacs-global-user-map' for Emacs state commands (note: customized
bindings for Emacs state made to `vip-emacs-global-user-map' are *not*
inherited by Insert state).

   For more information on Viper keymaps, see the header of the file
`viper.el'.  If you wish to change a Viper binding, you can use the
`define-key' command, to modify `vip-vi-global-user-map',
`vip-insert-global-user-map', and `vip-emacs-global-user-map', as
explained below. Each of these key maps affects the corresponding Viper
state.  The keymap `vip-vi-global-user-map' also affects Viper's
Replace state.

If you want to bind a key, say `C-v', to the function that scrolls page
down and to make `0' display information on the current buffer, putting
this in `.vip' will do the trick in Vi state:
     (define-key vip-vi-global-user-map "\C-v" 'scroll-down)

To set a key globally,
     (define-key vip-emacs-global-user-map "\C-c m" 'smail)
     (define-key vip-vi-global-user-map "0" 'vip-info-on-file)

Note, however, that this binding may be overwritten by other keymaps,
since the global keymap has the lowest priority.  To make sure that
nothing will override a binding in Emacs state, you can write this:
     (define-key vip-emacs-global-user-map "\C-c m" 'smail)

To customize the binding for `C-h' in Insert state:
     (define-key vip-insert-global-user-map "\C-h" 'my-del-backwards-function)

Each Emacs command key calls some lisp function. If you have enabled the
Help, (*Note Rudimentary Changes::) `C-h k' will show you the function
for each specific key; `C-h b' will show all bindings, and `C-h m' will
provide information on the major mode in effect. If Help is not
enabled, you can still get help in Vi state by prefixing the above
commands with `\', e.g., `\ C-h k' (or you can use the Help menu in the
menu bar, if Emacs runs under X Windows).

   Viper users can also change bindings on a per major mode basis.  As
with global bindings, this can be done separately for each of the three
main Viper states.  To this end, Viper provides the function
`vip-modify-major-mode'.

   To modify keys in Emacs state for `my-favorite-major-mode', the user
needs to create a sparse keymap, say, `my-fancy-map', bind whatever
keys necessary in that keymap, and put

     (vip-modify-major-mode 'dired-mode 'emacs-state my-fancy-map)

in `~/.vip'. To do the same in Vi and Insert states, one should use
`vi-state' and `insert-state'. Changes in Insert state are also in
effect in Replace state.  For instance, suppose that the user wants to
use `dd' in Vi state under Dired mode to delete files, `u' to unmark
files, etc. The following code in `~/.vip' will then do the job:

     (setq my-dired-modifier-map (make-sparse-keymap))
     (define-key my-dired-modifier-map "dd" 'dired-flag-file-deletion)
     (define-key my-dired-modifier-map "u" 'dired-unmark)
     (vip-modify-major-mode 'dired-mode 'vi-state my-dired-modifier-map)

   A Vi purist may want to modify Emacs state under Dired mode so that
`k', `l', etc., will move around in directory buffers, as in Vi.
Although this is not recommended, as these keys are bound to useful
Dired functions, the trick can be accomplished via the following code:

     (setq my-dired-vi-purist-map (make-sparse-keymap))
     (define-key my-dired-vi-purist-map "k" 'vip-previous-line)
     (define-key my-dired-vi-purist-map "l" 'vip-forward-char)
     (vip-modify-major-mode 'dired-mode 'emacs-state my-dired-vi-purist-map)

   Similar effect can be achieved by defining Vi keyboard macros using
the Ex commands `:map' and `:map!'. The difference is that multi-key Vi
macros do not override the keys they are bound to, unless these keys are
typed in quick succession. So, with macros, one can use the normal keys
alongside with the macros. If per-mode modifications are needed, the
user can try both ways and see which one is more convenient.  *Note Vi
Macros::, for details.

   Note: in major modes that come up in *Emacs state* by default, the
aforesaid modifications may not take place immediately (but only after
the buffer switches to some other Viper state and then back to Emacs
state).  To avoid this, one should add `vip-change-state-to-emacs' to an
appropriate hook of that major mode. (Check the function
`vip-set-hooks' in `viper.el' for examples.)  However, if you have set
`vip-always' to `t', chances are that you won't need to perform the
above procedure, because Viper will take care of most useful defaults.

   Finally, Viper has a facility that lets the user define per-buffer
bindings, i.e., bindings that are in effect in some specific buffers
only. Unlike per-mode bindings described above, per-buffer bindings can
be defined based on considerations other than the major mode.  This is
done via the function `vip-add-local-keys', which lets one specify
bindings that should be in effect in the current buffer only and for a
specific Viper state. For instance,
     (vip-add-local-keys 'vi-state '(("ZZ" . TeX-command-master)
                                     ("ZQ" . vip-save-kill-buffer)))

redefines `ZZ' to invoke `TeX-command-master' in `vi-state' and `ZQ' to
save-then-kill the current buffer. These bindings take effect only in
the buffer where this command is executed. The typical use of this
function is to execute the above expression from within a function that
is included in a hook to some major mode. For instance, the above
expression could be called from a function, `my-tex-init', which may be
added to `tex-mode-hook' as follows:
     (add-hook 'tex-mode-hook 'my-tex-init)

When TeX mode starts, the hook is executed and the above Lisp
expression is evaluated. Then, the bindings for `ZZ' and `ZQ' are
changed in Vi command mode for all buffers in TeX mode.

   Another useful application is to bind `ZZ' to `send-mail' in the
Mail mode buffers (the specifics of this depend on which mail package
you are using, `rmail', `mh-e', `vm', etc.  For instance, here is how
to do this for `mh-e', the Emacs interface to MH:
     (defun mh-add-vi-keys ()
       "Set up ZZ for MH-e and XMH."
       (vip-add-local-keys 'vi-state '(("ZZ" . mh-send-letter))))
     (add-hook 'mh-letter-mode-hook 'mh-add-vi-keys)

   You can also use `vip-add-local-keys' to set per buffer bindings in
Insert state and Emacs state by passing as a parameter the symbols
`'insert-state' and `'emacs-state', respectively.  As with global
bindings, customized local bindings done to Emacs state are not
inherited by Insert state.

   On rare occasions, local keys may be added by mistake. Usually this
is done indirectly, by invoking a major mode that adds local keys (e.g.,
`shell-mode' redefines `RET'). In such a case, exiting the wrong major
mode won't rid you from unwanted local keys, since these keys are local
to Viper state and the current buffer, not to the major mode.  In such
situations, the remedy is to type `M-x vip-zap-local-keys'.

   So much about Viper-specific bindings.  *Note Customization:

Packages that Change Keymaps
----------------------------

   Viper is designed to coexist with all major and minor modes of
Emacs. This means that bindings set by those modes are generally
available with Viper (unless you explicitly prohibit them by setting
`vip-want-emacs-keys-in-vi' and `vip-want-emacs-keys-in-insert' to
`nil').  If `vip-always' is set to `t', Viper will try to bring each
buffer in the a Viper state that is most appropriate for that buffer.
Usually, this would be the Vi state, but sometimes it could be the
Insert state or the Emacs state.

   Some major mode bindings will necessarily be overwritten by Viper.
Indeed, in Vi state, most of the 1-character keys are used for Vi-style
editing.  This usually causes no problems because most packages
designed for editing files typically do not bind such keys. Instead,
they use key sequences that start with `C-x' and `C-c'. This is why it
was so important for us to free up `C-x' and `C-c'.  It is common for
language-specific major modes to bind `TAB' and `LFD' (the line feed)
keys to various formatting functions. This is extremely useful, but may
require some getting used to for a Vi user. If you decide that this
feature is not for you, you can re-bind these keys as explained earlier
(*Note Customization::).

   Binding for `TAB' is one of the most unusual aspects of Viper for
many novice users.  In Emacs, `TAB' is used to format text and
programs, and is extremely useful. For instance, hitting `TAB' causes
the current line to be re-indented in accordance with the context.  In
programming, this is very important, since improper automatic
indentation would immediately alert the programmer to a possible error.
For instance, if a `)' or a `"' is missing somewhere above the current
line, `TAB' is likely to mis-indent the line.

   For this reason, Viper doesn't change the standard Emacs binding of
`TAB', thereby sacrificing Vi compatibility (except for users at level
1). Instead, in Viper, the key `S-tab' (shift+ tab) is chosen to
emulate Vi's `TAB'.

   We should note that on some non-windowing terminals, Shift doesn't
modify the `TAB' key, so `S-tab' behaves as if it were `TAB'. In such a
case, you will have to bind `vip-insert-tab' to some other convenient
key.

   Some packages, notably Dired, Gnus, Info, etc., attach special
meaning to common keys like `SPC', `x', `d', `v', and others. This
means that Vi command state is inappropriate for working with these
packages. Fortunately, these modes operate on read-only buffers and are
designed not for editing files, but for special-purpose browsing,
reading news, mail, etc., and Vi commands are meaningless in these
situations. For this reason, Viper doesn't force Vi state on such major
modes.  Rather, it brings them in Emacs state. You can switch to Vi
state by typing `C-z' if, for instance, you want to do Vi-style search
in a buffer (although, usually, incremental search, which is bound to
`C-s', is sufficient in these situations). But you should then switch
back to Emacs state if you plan to continue using these major modes
productively. You can also switch to Vi temporarily, to execute one
1-character command. This is done by typing `M-C-z' (or `ESC C-z').
This facility cannot execute several complex Vi commands, such as `dw',
`de', etc.

   It is also possible to harness some major modes, even though they
may bind common keys to specialized commands. Harnessing can make sense
for modes that bind only a small number of common keys.  For instance,
if `vip-always' is set to `t' in your `~/.vip' file, Viper will harness
the Shell mode by changing the bindings for `C-m' and `C-d' using
`vip-add-local-keys' described in section on customization (*Note
Customization::). In general, there is no single recipe for harnessing
modes. It can be as simple as adding the function `viper-mode' to a
hook associated with the mode, or it can be more complex, as in the
case of Shell mode and Emerge. Take a look at `vip-set-hooks' function
for some examples.

   Conversely, it may be the case that most of the major modes harnessed
by `vip-set-hooks' function fit your working style, except one or two
cases. In this case, you may still be able to set `vip-always' to `t'
and then remove a hook that forces Vi command state. For instance, to
unharness `lisp-interaction-mode', you can put the following line in
your `.emacs' (not `.vip'!) file after `(require 'viper)':
     (remove-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'viper-mode)

   In some rare cases, some minor modes may override certain essential
bindings in Vi command state.  This is not really catastrophic because
this may happen only in the beginning, when the minor mode kicks in.
Typing `M-x viper-mode' will correct the situation.  Viper knows about
several such minor modes and takes care of them, so that the above trick
is usually not necessary.  If you find that some minor mode, e.g.,
`nasty-mode.el' interferes with Viper, putting the following in `.vip'
should fix the problem:
     (vip-harness-minor-mode "nasty-mode")

The argument to `vip-harness-minor-mode' is the name of the file for the
offending minor mode with the suffixes `.el' and `.elc' removed.

   It may be tricky, however, to find out which minor mode is at fault.
The only guidance here is to look into the file that defines the minor
mode you are suspecting, say `nasty-mode.el', and see if it has a
variable called `nasty-mode-map'. Then check if there is a statement of
the form
     (define-key nasty-mode-map key function)

that binds the misbehaving keys. If so, use the above line to harness
`nasty-mode'. If your suspicion is wrong, no harm is done if you
harness a minor mode that doesn't need to be harnessed.
