Examining And Comparing Old Versions
------------------------------------

`C-u C-x C-q VERSION <RET>'
     Select version VERSION as the current work file version.

`C-x v ~ VERSION <RET>'
     Examine version VERSION of the visited file, in a buffer of its
     own.

`C-x v ='
     Compare the current buffer contents with the latest checked-in
     version of the file.

`C-u C-x v = FILE <RET> OLDVERS <RET> NEWVERS <RET>'
     Compare the specified two versions of FILE.

`C-x v g'
     Display the result of the CVS annotate command using colors.

   There are two ways to work with an old version of a file.  You can
make the old version your current work file, for example if you want to
reproduce a former stage of development, or if you want to create a
branch from the old version (*note Branches::.).  To do this, visit the
file and type `C-u C-x C-q VERSION <RET>'.  (This works only with RCS.)

   If you want only to examine an old version, without changing your
work file, visit the file and then type `C-x v ~ VERSION <RET>'
(`vc-version-other-window').  This puts the text of version VERSION in
a file named `FILENAME.~VERSION~', and visits it in its own buffer in a
separate window.

   To compare two versions of a file, use the command `C-x v ='
(`vc-diff').  Plain `C-x v =' compares the current buffer contents
(saving them in the file if necessary) with the last checked-in version
of the file.  `C-u C-x v =', with a numeric argument, reads a file name
and two version numbers, then compares those versions of the specified
file.

   If you supply a directory name instead of the name of a work file,
this command compares the two specified versions of all registered files
in that directory and its subdirectories.  You can also specify a
snapshot name (*note Snapshots::.) instead of one or both version
numbers.

   You can specify a checked-in version by its number; an empty input
specifies the current contents of the work file (which may be different
from all the checked-in versions).

   This command works by running the `diff' utility, getting the
options from the variable `diff-switches'.  It displays the output in a
special buffer in another window.  Unlike the `M-x diff' command, `C-x
v =' does not try to locate the changes in the old and new versions.
This is because normally one or both versions do not exist as files
when you compare them; they exist only in the records of the master
file.  *Note Comparing Files::, for more information about `M-x diff'.

   For CVS-controlled files, you can display the result of the CVS
annotate command, using colors to enhance the visual appearance.  Use
the command `M-x vc-annotate' to do this.  Red means new, blue means
old, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  A prefix
argument N specifies a stretch factor for the time scale; it makes each
color cover a period N times as long.

Multiple Branches of a File
---------------------------

   One use of version control is to maintain multiple "current"
versions of a file.  For example, you might have different versions of a
program in which you are gradually adding various unfinished new
features.  Each such independent line of development is called a
"branch".  VC allows you to create branches, and switch between
existing branches.  Note, however, that branches are supported only with
RCS.

   A file's main line of development is usually called the "trunk".
The versions on the trunk are normally numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.  At
any such version, you may start an independent branch.  A branch
starting at version 1.2 would have version number 1.2.1.1.  Consecutive
versions on this branch would have numbers 1.2.1.2, 1.2.1.3, 1.2.1.4,
and so on.  If there is a second branch also starting at version 1.2; it
would consist of versions 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2, 1.2.2.3, and so on.

   If you omit the final component of a version number, that is called a
"branch number".  It refers to the highest existing version on that
branch.  The branches in the example above have branch numbers 1.2.1 and
1.2.2.

   A version which is the last in its branch is called a "head" version.

Switching between Branches
..........................

   To switch between branches, type `C-u C-x C-q' and specify the
version number you want to select.  This version is then checked out
*unlocked* (write-protected), so you can examine it before really
checking it out.  Switching branches in this way is allowed only when
the file is not locked.

   You may omit the minor version number, thus giving only the branch
number; this takes you to the highest version on the indicated branch.
If you only type `RET', Emacs goes to the highest version on the trunk.

   After you have switched to any branch (including the main branch),
you stay on it for subsequent VC commands, until you explicitly select
some other branch.


File: emacs,  Node: Creating Branches,  Next: Multi-User Branching,  Prev: Switching Branches,  Up: Branches

Creating New Branches
.....................

   To create a new branch from a head version (one that is the latest in
the branch that contains it), first select that version if necessary,
lock it with `C-x C-q', and make whatever changes you want.  Then, when
you check in the changes, use `C-u C-x C-q'.  This lets you specify the
version number for the new version.  You should specify a suitable
branch number for a branch starting at the current version.  For
example, if the current version is 2.5, the branch number should be
2.5.1, 2.5.2, and so on, depending on the number of existing branches at
that point.

   To create a new branch at an older version (one that is no longer the
head of a branch), first select that version, then lock it with `C-x
C-q'.  You'll be asked to confirm, when you lock the old version, that
you really mean to create a new branch--if you say no, you'll be offered
a chance to lock the latest version instead.

   Then make your changes and type `C-x C-q' again to check in a new
version.  This automatically creates a new branch starting from the
selected version.  You need not specially request a new branch, because
that's the only way to add a new version at a point that is not the head
of a branch.

   After the branch is created, you "stay" on it.  That means that
subsequent check-outs and check-ins create new versions on that branch.
To leave the branch, you must explicitly select a different version with
`C-u C-x C-q' for check-out.


File: emacs,  Node: Multi-User Branching,  Prev: Creating Branches,  Up: Branches

Multi-User Branching
....................

   It is sometimes useful for multiple developers to work simultaneously
on different branches of a file.  This is possible if you create
multiple source directories.  Each source directory should have a link
named `RCS' which points to a common directory of RCS master files.
Then each source directory can have its own choice of versions checked
out, but all share the same common RCS records.

   This technique works reliably and automatically, provided that the
source files contain RCS version headers (*note Version Headers::.).
The headers enable Emacs to be sure, at all times, which version number
is present in the work file.

   If the files do not have version headers, you must instead tell Emacs
explicitly in each session which branch you are working on.  To do this,
first find the file, then type `C-u C-x C-q' and specify the correct
branch number.  This ensures that Emacs knows which branch it is using
during this particular editing session.

VC Status Commands
------------------

   To view the detailed version control status and history of a file,
type `C-x v l' (`vc-print-log').  It displays the history of changes to
the current file, including the text of the log entries.  The output
appears in a separate window.

   When you are working on a large program, it's often useful to find
all the files that are currently locked, or all the files maintained in
version control at all.  You can use `C-x v d' (`vc-directory') to show
all the locked files in or beneath a certain directory.  This includes
all files that are locked by any user.  `C-u C-x v d' lists all files
in or beneath the specified directory that are maintained with version
control.

   The list of files is displayed as a buffer that uses an augmented
Dired mode.  The names of the users locking various files are shown (in
parentheses) in place of the owner and group.  (With CVS, a more
detailed status is shown for each file.)  All the normal Dired commands
work in this buffer.  Most interactive VC commands work also, and apply
to the file name on the current line.

   The `C-x v v' command (`vc-next-action'), when used in the augmented
Dired buffer, operates on all the marked files (or the file on the
current line).  If it operates on more than one file, it handles each
file according to its current state; thus, it may check out one file
and check in another (because it is already checked out).  If it has to
check in any files, it reads a single log entry, then uses that text
for all the files being checked in.  This can be convenient for
registering or checking in several files at once, as part of the same
change.

Renaming VC Work Files and Master Files
---------------------------------------

   When you rename a registered file, you must also rename its master
file correspondingly to get proper results.  Use `vc-rename-file' to
rename the source file as you specify, and rename its master file
accordingly.  It also updates any snapshots (*note Snapshots::.) that
mention the file, so that they use the new name; despite this, the
snapshot thus modified may not completely work (*note Snapshot
Caveats::.).

   You cannot use `vc-rename-file' on a file that is locked by someone
else.


File: emacs,  Node: Snapshots,  Next: Version Headers,  Prev: Renaming and VC,  Up: Version Control

Snapshots
---------

   A "snapshot" is a named set of file versions (one for each
registered file) that you can treat as a unit.  One important kind of
snapshot is a "release", a (theoretically) stable version of the system
that is ready for distribution to users.

* Menu:

* Making Snapshots::		The snapshot facilities.
* Snapshot Caveats::		Things to be careful of when using snapshots.


File: emacs,  Node: Making Snapshots,  Next: Snapshot Caveats,  Up: Snapshots

Making and Using Snapshots
..........................

   There are two basic commands for snapshots; one makes a snapshot
with a given name, the other retrieves a named snapshot.

`C-x v s NAME <RET>'
     Define the last saved versions of every registered file in or
     under the current directory as a snapshot named NAME
     (`vc-create-snapshot').

`C-x v r NAME <RET>'
     Check out all registered files at or below the current directory
     level using whatever versions correspond to the snapshot NAME
     (`vc-retrieve-snapshot').

     This command reports an error if any files are locked at or below
     the current directory, without changing anything; this is to avoid
     overwriting work in progress.

   A snapshot uses a very small amount of resources--just enough to
record the list of file names and which version belongs to the
snapshot.  Thus, you need not hesitate to create snapshots whenever
they are useful.

   You can give a snapshot name as an argument to `C-x v =' or `C-x v
~' (*note Old Versions::.).  Thus, you can use it to compare a snapshot
against the current files, or two snapshots against each other, or a
snapshot against a named version.


File: emacs,  Node: Snapshot Caveats,  Prev: Making Snapshots,  Up: Snapshots

Snapshot Caveats
................

   VC's snapshot facilities are modeled on RCS's named-configuration
support.  They use RCS's native facilities for this, so under VC
snapshots made using RCS are visible even when you bypass VC.

   For SCCS, VC implements snapshots itself.  The files it uses contain
name/file/version-number triples.  These snapshots are visible only
through VC.

   A snapshot is a set of checked-in versions.  So make sure that all
the files are checked in and not locked when you make a snapshot.

   File renaming and deletion can create some difficulties with
snapshots.  This is not a VC-specific problem, but a general design
issue in version control systems that no one has solved very well yet.

   If you rename a registered file, you need to rename its master along
with it (the command `vc-rename-file' does this automatically).  If you
are using SCCS, you must also update the records of the snapshot, to
mention the file by its new name (`vc-rename-file' does this, too).  An
old snapshot that refers to a master file that no longer exists under
the recorded name is invalid; VC can no longer retrieve it.  It would
be beyond the scope of this manual to explain enough about RCS and SCCS
to explain how to update the snapshots by hand.

   Using `vc-rename-file' makes the snapshot remain valid for
retrieval, but it does not solve all problems.  For example, some of the
files in the program probably refer to others by name.  At the very
least, the makefile probably mentions the file that you renamed.  If you
retrieve an old snapshot, the renamed file is retrieved under its new
name, which is not the name that the makefile expects.  So the program
won't really work as retrieved.


File: emacs,  Node: Version Headers,  Next: Customizing VC,  Prev: Snapshots,  Up: Version Control

Inserting Version Control Headers
---------------------------------

   Sometimes it is convenient to put version identification strings
directly into working files.  Certain special strings called "version
headers" are replaced in each successive version by the number of that
version.

   If you are using RCS, and version headers are present in your working
files, Emacs can use them to determine the current version and the
locking state of the files.  This is more reliable than referring to the
master files, which is done when there are no version headers.  Note
that in a multi-branch environment, version headers are necessary to
make VC behave correctly (*note Multi-User Branching::.).

   Searching for version headers is controlled by the variable
`vc-consult-headers'.  If it is non-`nil', Emacs searches for headers
to determine the version number you are editing.  Setting it to `nil'
disables this feature.

   You can use the `C-x v h' command (`vc-insert-headers') to insert a
suitable header string.

`C-x v h'
     Insert headers in a file for use with your version-control system.

   The default header string is `$Id$' for RCS and `%W%' for SCCS.  You
can specify other headers to insert by setting the variable
`vc-header-alist'.  Its value is a list of elements of the form
`(PROGRAM . STRING)' where PROGRAM is `RCS' or `SCCS' and STRING is the
string to use.

   Instead of a single string, you can specify a list of strings; then
each string in the list is inserted as a separate header on a line of
its own.

   It is often necessary to use "superfluous" backslashes when writing
the strings that you put in this variable.  This is to prevent the
string in the constant from being interpreted as a header itself if the
Emacs Lisp file containing it is maintained with version control.

   Each header is inserted surrounded by tabs, inside comment
delimiters, on a new line at the start of the buffer.  Normally the
ordinary comment start and comment end strings of the current mode are
used, but for certain modes, there are special comment delimiters for
this purpose; the variable `vc-comment-alist' specifies them.  Each
element of this list has the form `(MODE STARTER ENDER)'.

   The variable `vc-static-header-alist' specifies further strings to
add based on the name of the buffer.  Its value should be a list of
elements of the form `(REGEXP . FORMAT)'.  Whenever REGEXP matches the
buffer name, FORMAT is inserted as part of the header.  A header line
is inserted for each element that matches the buffer name, and for each
string specified by `vc-header-alist'.  The header line is made by
processing the string from `vc-header-alist' with the format taken from
the element.  The default value for `vc-static-header-alist' is as
follows:

     (("\\.c$" .
       "\n#ifndef lint\nstatic char vcid[] = \"\%s\";\n\
     #endif /* lint */\n"))

It specifies insertion of text of this form:


     #ifndef lint
     static char vcid[] = "STRING";
     #endif /* lint */

Note that the text above starts with a blank line.

   If you use more than one version header in a file, put them close
together in the file.  The mechanism in `revert-buffer' that preserves
markers may not handle markers positioned between two version headers.

Customizing VC
--------------

   There are many ways of customizing VC.  The variables that control
its behavior fall into three categories, described in the following
sections.

* Menu:

* VC Workfile Handling::  Various options concerning working files.
* VC Status Retrieval::   How VC finds the version control status of a file,
                            and how to customize this.
* VC Command Execution::  Which commands VC should run, and how.


File: emacs,  Node: VC Workfile Handling,  Next: VC Status Retrieval,  Up: Customizing VC

VC Workfile Handling
....................

   Emacs normally does not save backup files for source files that are
maintained with version control.  If you want to make backup files even
for files that use version control, set the variable
`vc-make-backup-files' to a non-`nil' value.

   Normally the work file exists all the time, whether it is locked or
not.  If you set `vc-keep-workfiles' to `nil', then checking in a new
version with `C-x C-q' deletes the work file; but any attempt to visit
the file with Emacs creates it again.  (With CVS, work files are always
kept.)

   Editing a version-controlled file through a symbolic link can be
dangerous.  It bypasses the version control system--you can edit the
file without checking it out, and fail to check your changes in.  Also,
your changes might overwrite those of another user.  To protect against
this, VC checks each symbolic link that you visit, to see if it points
to a file under version control.

   The variable `vc-follow-symlinks' controls what to do when a
symbolic link points to a version-controlled file.  If it is `nil', VC
only displays a warning message.  If it is `t', VC automatically
follows the link, and visits the real file instead, telling you about
this in the echo area.  If the value is `ask' (the default), VC asks
you each time whether to follow the link.


File: emacs,  Node: VC Status Retrieval,  Next: VC Command Execution,  Prev: VC Workfile Handling,  Up: Customizing VC

VC Status Retrieval
...................

   When deducing the locked/unlocked state of a file, VC first looks for
an RCS version header string in the file (*note Version Headers::.).  If
there is no header string, or if you are using SCCS, VC normally looks
at the file permissions of the work file; this is fast.  But there might
be situations when the file permissions cannot be trusted.  In this case
the master file has to be consulted, which is rather expensive.  Also
the master file can only tell you *if* there's any lock on the file,
but not whether your work file really contains that locked version.

   You can tell VC not to use version headers to determine lock status
by setting `vc-consult-headers' to `nil'.  VC then always uses the file
permissions (if it can trust them), or else checks the master file.

   You can specify the criterion for whether to trust the file
permissions by setting the variable `vc-mistrust-permissions'.  Its
value may be `t' (always mistrust the file permissions and check the
master file), `nil' (always trust the file permissions), or a function
of one argument which makes the decision.  The argument is the
directory name of the `RCS', `CVS' or `SCCS' subdirectory.  A non-`nil'
value from the function says to mistrust the file permissions.  If you
find that the file permissions of work files are changed erroneously,
set `vc-mistrust-permissions' to `t'.  Then VC always checks the master
file to determine the file's status.


File: emacs,  Node: VC Command Execution,  Prev: VC Status Retrieval,  Up: Customizing VC

VC Command Execution
....................

   If `vc-suppress-confirm' is non-`nil', then `C-x C-q' and `C-x v i'
can save the current buffer without asking, and `C-x v u' also operates
without asking for confirmation.  (This variable does not affect `C-x v
c'; that operation is so drastic that it should always ask for
confirmation.)

   VC mode does much of its work by running the shell commands for RCS,
CVS and SCCS.  If `vc-command-messages' is non-`nil', VC displays
messages to indicate which shell commands it runs, and additional
messages when the commands finish.

   You can specify additional directories to search for version control
programs by setting the variable `vc-path'.  These directories are
searched before the usual search path.  But the proper files are usually
found automatically.


File: emacs,  Node: Directories,  Next: Comparing Files,  Prev: Version Control,  Up: Files

File Directories
================

   The file system groups files into "directories".  A "directory
listing" is a list of all the files in a directory.  Emacs provides
commands to create and delete directories, and to make directory
listings in brief format (file names only) and verbose format (sizes,
dates, and authors included).  There is also a directory browser called
Dired; see *Note Dired::.

`C-x C-d DIR-OR-PATTERN <RET>'
     Display a brief directory listing (`list-directory').

`C-u C-x C-d DIR-OR-PATTERN <RET>'
     Display a verbose directory listing.

`M-x make-directory <RET> DIRNAME <RET>'
     Create a new directory named DIRNAME.

`M-x delete-directory <RET> DIRNAME <RET>'
     Delete the directory named DIRNAME.  It must be empty, or you get
     an error.

   The command to display a directory listing is `C-x C-d'
(`list-directory').  It reads using the minibuffer a file name which is
either a directory to be listed or a wildcard-containing pattern for
the files to be listed.  For example,

     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/etc <RET>

lists all the files in directory `/u2/emacs/etc'.  Here is an example
of specifying a file name pattern:

     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/src/*.c <RET>

   Normally, `C-x C-d' prints a brief directory listing containing just
file names.  A numeric argument (regardless of value) tells it to make
a verbose listing including sizes, dates, and authors (like `ls -l').

   The text of a directory listing is obtained by running `ls' in an
inferior process.  Two Emacs variables control the switches passed to
`ls': `list-directory-brief-switches' is a string giving the switches
to use in brief listings (`"-CF"' by default), and
`list-directory-verbose-switches' is a string giving the switches to
use in a verbose listing (`"-l"' by default).


File: emacs,  Node: Comparing Files,  Next: Misc File Ops,  Prev: Directories,  Up: Files

Comparing Files
===============

   The command `M-x diff' compares two files, displaying the
differences in an Emacs buffer named `*Diff*'.  It works by running the
`diff' program, using options taken from the variable `diff-switches',
whose value should be a string.

   The buffer `*Diff*' has Compilation mode as its major mode, so you
can use `C-x `' to visit successive changed locations in the two source
files.  You can also move to a particular hunk of changes and type
<RET> or `C-c C-c', or click `Mouse-2' on it, to move to the
corresponding source location.  You can also use the other special
commands of Compilation mode: <SPC> and <DEL> for scrolling, and `M-p'
and `M-n' for cursor motion.  *Note Compilation::.

   The command `M-x diff-backup' compares a specified file with its most
recent backup.  If you specify the name of a backup file, `diff-backup'
compares it with the source file that it is a backup of.

   The command `M-x compare-windows' compares the text in the current
window with that in the next window.  Comparison starts at point in each
window, and each starting position is pushed on the mark ring in its
respective buffer.  Then point moves forward in each window, a character
at a time, until a mismatch between the two windows is reached.  Then
the command is finished.  For more information about windows in Emacs,
*Note Windows::.

   With a numeric argument, `compare-windows' ignores changes in
whitespace.  If the variable `compare-ignore-case' is non-`nil', it
ignores differences in case as well.

   See also *Note Emerge::, for convenient facilities for merging two
similar files.

Miscellaneous File Operations
=============================

   Emacs has commands for performing many other operations on files.
All operate on one file; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   `M-x view-file' allows you to scan or read a file by sequential
screenfuls.  It reads a file name argument using the minibuffer.  After
reading the file into an Emacs buffer, `view-file' displays the
beginning.  You can then type <SPC> to scroll forward one windowful, or
<DEL> to scroll backward.  Various other commands are provided for
moving around in the file, but none for changing it; type `?'  while
viewing for a list of them.  They are mostly the same as normal Emacs
cursor motion commands.  To exit from viewing, type `q'.  The commands
for viewing are defined by a special major mode called View mode.

   A related command, `M-x view-buffer', views a buffer already present
in Emacs.  *Note Misc Buffer::.

   `M-x insert-file' inserts a copy of the contents of the specified
file into the current buffer at point, leaving point unchanged before
the contents and the mark after them.

   `M-x write-region' is the inverse of `M-x insert-file'; it copies
the contents of the region into the specified file.  `M-x
append-to-file' adds the text of the region to the end of the specified
file.  *Note Accumulating Text::.

   `M-x delete-file' deletes the specified file, like the `rm' command
in the shell.  If you are deleting many files in one directory, it may
be more convenient to use Dired (*note Dired::.).

   `M-x rename-file' reads two file names OLD and NEW using the
minibuffer, then renames file OLD as NEW.  If a file named NEW already
exists, you must confirm with `yes' or renaming is not done; this is
because renaming causes the old meaning of the name NEW to be lost.  If
OLD and NEW are on different file systems, the file OLD is copied and
deleted.

   The similar command `M-x add-name-to-file' is used to add an
additional name to an existing file without removing its old name.  The
new name must belong on the same file system that the file is on.

   `M-x copy-file' reads the file OLD and writes a new file named NEW
with the same contents.  Confirmation is required if a file named NEW
already exists, because copying has the consequence of overwriting the
old contents of the file NEW.

   `M-x make-symbolic-link' reads two file names TARGET and LINKNAME,
then creates a symbolic link named LINKNAME and pointing at TARGET.
The effect is that future attempts to open file LINKNAME will refer to
whatever file is named TARGET at the time the opening is done, or will
get an error if the name TARGET is not in use at that time.  This
command does not expand the argument TARGET, so that it allows you to
specify a relative name as the target of the link.

   Confirmation is required when creating the link if LINKNAME is in
use.  Note that not all systems support symbolic links.


File: emacs,  Node: Compressed Files,  Next: Remote Files,  Prev: Misc File Ops,  Up: Files

Accessing Compressed Files
==========================

   Emacs comes with a library that can automatically uncompress
compressed files when you visit them, and automatically recompress them
if you alter them and save them.  To enable this feature, type the
command `M-x auto-compression-mode'.

   When automatic compression (which implies automatic uncompression as
well) is enabled, Emacs recognizes compressed files by their file names.
File names ending in `.gz' indicate a file compressed with `gzip'.
Other endings indicate other compression programs.

   Automatic uncompression and compression apply to all the operations
in which Emacs uses the contents of a file.  This includes visiting it,
saving it, inserting its contents into a buffer, loading it, and byte
compiling it.

Remote Files
============

   You can refer to files on other machines using a special file name
syntax:

     /HOST:FILENAME
     /USER@HOST:FILENAME

When you do this, Emacs uses the FTP program to read and write files on
the specified host.  It logs in through FTP using your user name or the
name USER.  It may ask you for a password from time to time; this is
used for logging in on HOST.

   You can entirely turn off the FTP file name feature by setting the
variable `file-name-handler-alist' to `nil'.

   The Emacs package that implements FTP file access is called
`ange-ftp'.  However, you don't need to remember that name to use the
FTP file access feature.

Quoted File Names
=================

   You can "quote" an absolute file name to prevent special characters
and syntax in it from having their special effects.  The way to do this
is to add `/:' at the beginning.

   For example, you can quote a local file name which appears remote, to
prevent it from being treated as a remote file name.  Thus, if you have
a directory named `/foo:' and a file named `bar' in it, you can refer
to that file in Emacs as `/:/foo:/bar'.

   `/:' can also prevent `~' from being treated as a special character
for a user's home directory.  For example, `/:/tmp/~hack' refers to a
file whose name is `~hack' in directory `/tmp'.

   Likewise, quoting with `/:' is one way to enter in the minibuffer a
file name that contains `$'.  However, the `/:' must be at the
beginning of the buffer in order to quote `$'.

Using Multiple Buffers
**********************

   The text you are editing in Emacs resides in an object called a
"buffer".  Each time you visit a file, a buffer is created to hold the
file's text.  Each time you invoke Dired, a buffer is created to hold
the directory listing.  If you send a message with `C-x m', a buffer
named `*mail*' is used to hold the text of the message.  When you ask
for a command's documentation, that appears in a buffer called `*Help*'.

   At any time, one and only one buffer is "selected".  It is also
called the "current buffer".  Often we say that a command operates on
"the buffer" as if there were only one; but really this means that the
command operates on the selected buffer (most commands do).

   When Emacs has multiple windows, each window has a chosen buffer
which is displayed there, but at any time only one of the windows is
selected and its chosen buffer is the selected buffer.  Each window's
mode line displays the name of the buffer that the window is displaying
(*note Windows::.).

   Each buffer has a name, which can be of any length, and you can
select any buffer by giving its name.  Most buffers are made by
visiting files, and their names are derived from the files' names.  But
you can also create an empty buffer with any name you want.  A newly
started Emacs has a buffer named `*scratch*' which can be used for
evaluating Lisp expressions in Emacs.  The distinction between upper
and lower case matters in buffer names.

   Each buffer records individually what file it is visiting, whether
it is modified, and what major mode and minor modes are in effect in it
(*note Major Modes::.).  Any Emacs variable can be made "local to" a
particular buffer, meaning its value in that buffer can be different
from the value in other buffers.  *Note Locals::.

Creating and Selecting Buffers
==============================

`C-x b BUFFER <RET>'
     Select or create a buffer named BUFFER (`switch-to-buffer').

`C-x 4 b BUFFER <RET>'
     Similar, but select BUFFER in another window
     (`switch-to-buffer-other-window').

`C-x 5 b BUFFER <RET>'
     Similar, but select BUFFER in a separate frame
     (`switch-to-buffer-other-frame').

   To select the buffer named BUFNAME, type `C-x b BUFNAME <RET>'.
This runs the command `switch-to-buffer' with argument BUFNAME.  You
can use completion on an abbreviation for the buffer name you want
(*note Completion::.).  An empty argument to `C-x b' specifies the most
recently selected buffer that is not displayed in any window.

   Most buffers are created by visiting files, or by Emacs commands that
want to display some text, but you can also create a buffer explicitly
by typing `C-x b BUFNAME <RET>'.  This makes a new, empty buffer that
is not visiting any file, and selects it for editing.  Such buffers are
used for making notes to yourself.  If you try to save one, you are
asked for the file name to use.  The new buffer's major mode is
determined by the value of `default-major-mode' (*note Major Modes::.).

   Note that `C-x C-f', and any other command for visiting a file, can
also be used to switch to an existing file-visiting buffer.  *Note
Visiting::.

   Emacs uses buffer names that start with a space for internal
purposes.  It treats these buffers specially in minor ways--for
example, by default they do not record undo information.  It is best to
avoid using such buffer names yourself.


File: emacs,  Node: List Buffers,  Next: Misc Buffer,  Prev: Select Buffer,  Up: Buffers

Listing Existing Buffers
========================

`C-x C-b'
     List the existing buffers (`list-buffers').

   To display a list of all the buffers that exist, type `C-x C-b'.
Each line in the list shows one buffer's name, major mode and visited
file.  The buffers are listed in the order that they were current; the
buffers that were current most recently come first.

   `*' at the beginning of a line indicates the buffer is "modified."
If several buffers are modified, it may be time to save some with `C-x
s' (*note Saving::.).  `%' indicates a read-only buffer.  `.' marks the
selected buffer.  Here is an example of a buffer list:

      MR Buffer         Size  Mode           File
      -- ------         ----  ----           ----
     .*  emacs.tex      383402 Texinfo       /u2/emacs/man/emacs.tex
         *Help*         1287  Fundamental
         files.el       23076 Emacs-Lisp     /u2/emacs/lisp/files.el
       % RMAIL          64042 RMAIL          /u/rms/RMAIL
      *% man            747   Dired          /u2/emacs/man/
         net.emacs      343885 Fundamental   /u/rms/net.emacs
         fileio.c       27691 C              /u2/emacs/src/fileio.c
         NEWS           67340 Text           /u2/emacs/etc/NEWS
         *scratch*	   0	 Lisp Interaction

Note that the buffer `*Help*' was made by a help request; it is not
visiting any file.  The buffer `man' was made by Dired on the directory
`/u2/emacs/man/'.

Miscellaneous Buffer Operations
===============================

`C-x C-q'
     Toggle read-only status of buffer (`vc-toggle-read-only').

`M-x rename-buffer <RET> NAME <RET>'
     Change the name of the current buffer.

`M-x rename-uniquely'
     Rename the current buffer by adding `<NUMBER>' to the end.

`M-x view-buffer <RET> BUFFER <RET>'
     Scroll through buffer BUFFER.

   A buffer can be "read-only", which means that commands to change its
contents are not allowed.  The mode line indicates read-only buffers
with `%%' or `%*' near the left margin.  Read-only buffers are usually
made by subsystems such as Dired and Rmail that have special commands
to operate on the text; also by visiting a file whose access control
says you cannot write it.

   If you wish to make changes in a read-only buffer, use the command
`C-x C-q' (`vc-toggle-read-only').  It makes a read-only buffer
writable, and makes a writable buffer read-only.  In most cases, this
works by setting the variable `buffer-read-only', which has a local
value in each buffer and makes the buffer read-only if its value is
non-`nil'.  If the file is maintained with version control, `C-x C-q'
works through the version control system to change the read-only status
of the file as well as the buffer.  *Note Version Control::.

   `M-x rename-buffer' changes the name of the current buffer.  Specify
the new name as a minibuffer argument.  There is no default.  If you
specify a name that is in use for some other buffer, an error happens
and no renaming is done.

   `M-x rename-uniquely' renames the current buffer to a similar name
with a numeric suffix added to make it both different and unique.  This
command does not need an argument.  It is useful for creating multiple
shell buffers: if you rename the `*Shell*' buffer, then do `M-x shell'
again, it makes a new shell buffer named `*Shell*'; meanwhile, the old
shell buffer continues to exist under its new name.  This method is
also good for mail buffers, compilation buffers, and most Emacs
features that create special buffers with particular names.

   `M-x view-buffer' is much like `M-x view-file' (*note Misc File
Ops::.) except that it examines an already existing Emacs buffer.  View
mode provides commands for scrolling through the buffer conveniently
but not for changing it.  When you exit View mode, the value of point
that resulted from your perusal remains in effect.

   The commands `M-x append-to-buffer' and `M-x insert-buffer' can be
used to copy text from one buffer to another.  *Note Accumulating
Text::.

Killing Buffers
===============

   If you continue an Emacs session for a while, you may accumulate a
large number of buffers.  You may then find it convenient to "kill" the
buffers you no longer need.  On most operating systems, killing a
buffer releases its space back to the operating system so that other
programs can use it.  Here are some commands for killing buffers:

`C-x k BUFNAME <RET>'
     Kill buffer BUFNAME (`kill-buffer').

`M-x kill-some-buffers'
     Offer to kill each buffer, one by one.

   `C-x k' (`kill-buffer') kills one buffer, whose name you specify in
the minibuffer.  The default, used if you type just <RET> in the
minibuffer, is to kill the current buffer.  If you kill the current
buffer, another buffer is selected; one that has been selected recently
but does not appear in any window now.  If you ask to kill a
file-visiting buffer that is modified (has unsaved editing), then you
must confirm with `yes' before the buffer is killed.

   The command `M-x kill-some-buffers' asks about each buffer, one by
one.  An answer of `y' means to kill the buffer.  Killing the current
buffer or a buffer containing unsaved changes selects a new buffer or
asks for confirmation just like `kill-buffer'.

   The buffer menu feature (*note Several Buffers::.) is also convenient
for killing various buffers.

   If you want to do something special every time a buffer is killed,
you can add hook functions to the hook `kill-buffer-hook' (*note
Hooks::.).

Operating on Several Buffers
============================

   The "buffer-menu" facility is like a "Dired for buffers"; it allows
you to request operations on various Emacs buffers by editing an Emacs
buffer containing a list of them.  You can save buffers, kill them
(here called "deleting" them, for consistency with Dired), or display
them.

`M-x buffer-menu'
     Begin editing a buffer listing all Emacs buffers.

   The command `buffer-menu' writes a list of all Emacs buffers into
the buffer `*Buffer List*', and selects that buffer in Buffer Menu
mode.  The buffer is read-only, and can be changed only through the
special commands described in this section.  The usual Emacs cursor
motion commands can be used in the `*Buffer List*' buffer.  The
following commands apply to the buffer described on the current line.

`d'
     Request to delete (kill) the buffer, then move down.  The request
     shows as a `D' on the line, before the buffer name.  Requested
     deletions take place when you type the `x' command.

`C-d'
     Like `d' but move up afterwards instead of down.

`s'
     Request to save the buffer.  The request shows as an `S' on the
     line.  Requested saves take place when you type the `x' command.
     You may request both saving and deletion for the same buffer.

`x'
     Perform previously requested deletions and saves.

`u'
     Remove any request made for the current line, and move down.

`<DEL>'
     Move to previous line and remove any request made for that line.

   The `d', `C-d', `s' and `u' commands to add or remove flags also
move down (or up) one line.  They accept a numeric argument as a repeat
count.

   These commands operate immediately on the buffer listed on the
current line:

`~'
     Mark the buffer "unmodified."  The command `~' does this
     immediately when you type it.

`%'
     Toggle the buffer's read-only flag.  The command `%' does this
     immediately when you type it.

`t'
     Visit the buffer as a tags table.  *Note Select Tags Table::.

   There are also commands to select another buffer or buffers:

`q'
     Quit the buffer menu--immediately display the most recent formerly
     visible buffer in its place.

`<RET>'
`f'
     Immediately select this line's buffer in place of the `*Buffer
     List*' buffer.

`o'
     Immediately select this line's buffer in another window as if by
     `C-x 4 b', leaving `*Buffer List*' visible.

`C-o'
     Immediately display this line's buffer in another window, but don't
     select the window.

`1'
     Immediately select this line's buffer in a full-screen window.

`2'
     Immediately set up two windows, with this line's buffer in one,
     and the previously selected buffer (aside from the buffer `*Buffer
     List*') in the other.

`m'
     Mark this line's buffer to be displayed in another window if you
     exit with the `v' command.  The request shows as a `>' at the
     beginning of the line.  (A single buffer may not have both a delete
     request and a display request.)

`v'
     Immediately select this line's buffer, and also display in other
     windows any buffers previously marked with the `m' command.  If
     you have not marked any buffers, this command is equivalent to `1'.

   All that `buffer-menu' does directly is create and switch to a
suitable buffer, and turn on Buffer Menu mode.  Everything else
described above is implemented by the special commands provided in
Buffer Menu mode.  One consequence of this is that you can switch from
the `*Buffer List*' buffer to another Emacs buffer, and edit there.
You can reselect the `*Buffer List*' buffer later, to perform the
operations already requested, or you can kill it, or pay no further
attention to it.

   The only difference between `buffer-menu' and `list-buffers' is that
`buffer-menu' switches to the `*Buffer List*' buffer in the selected
window; `list-buffers' displays it in another window.  If you run
`list-buffers' (that is, type `C-x C-b') and select the buffer list
manually, you can use all of the commands described here.

   The buffer `*Buffer List*' is not updated automatically when buffers
are created and killed; its contents are just text.  If you have
created, deleted or renamed buffers, the way to update `*Buffer List*'
to show what you have done is to type `g' (`revert-buffer') or repeat
the `buffer-menu' command.


File: emacs,  Node: Indirect Buffers,  Prev: Several Buffers,  Up: Buffers

Indirect Buffers
================

   An "indirect buffer" shares the text of some other buffer, which is
called the "base buffer" of the indirect buffer.  In some ways it is
the analogue, for buffers, of a symbolic link between files.

`M-x make-indirect-buffer BASE-BUFFER <RET> INDIRECT-NAME <RET>'
     Create an indirect buffer named INDIRECT-NAME whose base buffer is
     BASE-BUFFER.

   The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of
its base buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible
immediately in the other.  But in all other respects, the indirect
buffer and its base buffer are completely separate.  They have
different names, different values of point, different narrowing,
different markers, different major modes, and different local variables.

   An indirect buffer cannot visit a file, but its base buffer can.  If
you try to save the indirect buffer, that actually works by saving the
base buffer.  Killing the base buffer effectively kills the indirect
buffer, but killing an indirect buffer has no effect on its base buffer.

   One way to use indirect buffers is to display multiple views of an
outline.  *Note Outline Views::.


File: emacs,  Node: Windows,  Next: Frames,  Prev: Buffers,  Up: Top

Multiple Windows
****************

   Emacs can split a frame into two or many windows.  Multiple windows
can display parts of different buffers, or different parts of one
buffer.  Multiple frames always imply multiple windows, because each
frame has its own set of windows.  Each window belongs to one and only
one frame.

* Menu:

* Basic Window::        Introduction to Emacs windows.
* Split Window::        New windows are made by splitting existing windows.
* Other Window::        Moving to another window or doing something to it.
* Pop Up Window::       Finding a file or buffer in another window.
* Force Same Window::   Forcing certain buffers to appear in the selected
                          window rather than in another window.
* Change Window::       Deleting windows and changing their sizes.


File: emacs,  Node: Basic Window,  Next: Split Window,  Up: Windows

Concepts of Emacs Windows
=========================

   Each Emacs window displays one Emacs buffer at any time.  A single
buffer may appear in more than one window; if it does, any changes in
its text are displayed in all the windows where it appears.  But the
windows showing the same buffer can show different parts of it, because
each window has its own value of point.

   At any time, one of the windows is the "selected window"; the buffer
this window is displaying is the current buffer.  The terminal's cursor
shows the location of point in this window.  Each other window has a
location of point as well, but since the terminal has only one cursor
there is no way to show where those locations are.  When multiple
frames are visible in X Windows, each frame has a cursor which appears
in the frame's selected window.  The cursor in the selected frame is
solid; the cursor in other frames is a hollow box.

   Commands to move point affect the value of point for the selected
Emacs window only.  They do not change the value of point in any other
Emacs window, even one showing the same buffer.  The same is true for
commands such as `C-x b' to change the selected buffer in the selected
window; they do not affect other windows at all.  However, there are
other commands such as `C-x 4 b' that select a different window and
switch buffers in it.  Also, all commands that display information in a
window, including (for example) `C-h f' (`describe-function') and `C-x
C-b' (`list-buffers'), work by switching buffers in a nonselected window
without affecting the selected window.

   When multiple windows show the same buffer, they can have different
regions, because they can have different values of point.  However,
they all have the same value for the mark, because each buffer has only
one mark position.

   Each window has its own mode line, which displays the buffer name,
modification status and major and minor modes of the buffer that is
displayed in the window.  *Note Mode Line::, for full details on the
mode line.
