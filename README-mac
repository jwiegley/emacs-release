1. What's this?

This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 23.  This provides a native
GUI support for Mac OS X 10.2 - 10.7.  Note that Emacs 23 already
contains the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for Mac OS X
10.4 and later.  So if it is good enough for you, then you don't need
to try this.

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

  This version should be regarded as experimental/hackers-only.
  Documentations are completely missing, no extra files such as the
  package creation convenience script `make-package', and things are
  subject to change/removal in an incompatible way.  Please refrain
  from distributing this in any different form, including for (binary)
  distribution basis, until the version gets to 2.0.

  Also, if you find a bug, then please try to reproduce it with some
  official builds such as X11 or NS (Cocoa).  If it turns out to be
  specific to the Mac port, then please report it to
  "mituharu+bug-gnu-emacs-mac@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp".  Otherwise (i.e.,
  it is also reproducible with official ones), report it using M-x
  report-emacs-bug *USING THE OFFICIAL BUILD* as such.

The Mac port is a descendant of the following ports for Mac OS X.

  * Carbon port for Emacs 22 (aka "Carbon Emacs", don't confuse it
    with "Carbon Emacs Package"): this is a part of the official GNU
    Emacs 22 distribution and provides native GUI support for Mac OS.
    It has been used in almost all the Emacs distributions/packages
    for Mac OS X with its native GUI.

    The Carbon port was initiated by Andrew Choi, using his Mac OS 8/9
    port as a basis.  He had been the maintainer of Mac OS port of GNU
    Emacs and participated in the development until late 2003.

    The Mac port inherits mostly the same features with the Carbon
    port including the following, all of which were added after 2004:

    - C-g handling
      You can quit (while t) and (shell-command "sleep 100").
      No bogus menu bar activation while these evaluations.

    - Emulation of `select' without periodic polling
      It doesn't use CPU time while the Lisp interpreter is idle and
      waiting for some events to come, even with subprocesses or
      network connections.

    - Graceful termination
      If you try logout/shutdown/reboot while leaving a file-visiting
      buffer modified and unsaved, a popup window appears for
      confirmation.  If you cancel the termination of Emacs (including
      C-g or ESC), the whole logout/shutdown/reboot process is also
      canceled immediately (i.e., you will see a "canceled" dialog
      immediately rather than a "timed out" one afterward).  If you
      don't have unsaved buffers, shell buffers, etc., you won't see
      unnecessary confirmation.

    - Apple event handling
      One can define Apple event handlers at the Lisp level.
      Actually, graceful termination above is an instance of
      Lisp-level Apple event handling.  Another example is "Get URL"
      handler that enables us to invoke the mailer you customized with
      `mail-user-agent', e.g.,

	$ osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs"
			to open location "mailto:foo@example.com"'

      If you set Emacs as the default mailer via Mail.app preference,
      the Emacs mailer will set up a draft buffer when you click a
      mailto: link in a Web browser.

    - DictionaryService support (10.4 and later)
      You can look up a word under the mouse pointer in the selected
      window by typing Command-Control-D (or double-tapping a trackpad
      with three fingers on Mac OS X 10.7).

  * Carbon+AppKit port for Emacs 22.3: this is a port of the Carbon
    port above.  The two ports differ in the GUI implementation basis:
    the Carbon port uses Carbon HIToolbox, but the Carbon+AppKit port
    uses the Cocoa Application Kit framework (AppKit).  The
    Carbon+AppKit port inherits the code of the non-GUI part of the
    Carbon port, such as drawing, font and image handling.  So in this
    sense, the Carbon+AppKit port can be regarded as a variant of the
    Carbon port.  Obviously, this is not a backport of the
    Cocoa/GNUstep port (aka "Emacs.app" or the NS port).

    The Mac port also inherits the features of the Carbon+AppKit port
    including the following:

    - Resolution independence (10.4 - 10.6, 10.5 recommended)
      Scaling works in Framework-Scaled Mode as opposed to (blurry)
      Magnified Mode for the Carbon port.
      Note: this type of resolution independence is deprecated on Mac
      OS X 10.7.

    - 64-bit (10.5 and later)
      You can build and run a 64-bit binary with GUI support by
      specifying CC='gcc -arch x86_64' or CC='gcc -arch ppc64' on
      configure.

    - Some minor visual enhancements
      * Aligned key bindings in menus
      * Progress indicator (corresponding to hourglass) in the title bar
      * Unusable items in the font panel are hidden
	Try Options -> Show/Hide -> Font Panel from the menu bar or
	M-x mac-font-panel-mode RET.
      * Update display while the resize control (or the slider in the
	font panel) is being dragged

Being a port of Emacs 23.3, the Mac port also supports the following
features besides those inherited from the above ancestors:

  * The `fullscreen' frame parameter, with all values supported:
    `fullboth', `fullwidth', `fullheight', and `maximized'.  The
    fullboth frames, which don't have the title bar, still allow us to
    access the menu bar, the Dock (Mac OS X 10.3 and later), and the
    tool bars.  The menu bar can also be activated via
    `menu-bar-open', `Control-F2' (if full keyboard access enabled),
    or `Command-Shift-/' (on Mac OS X 10.5 and later) even for
    fullboth frames where the menu bar is usually hidden.  Changing
    fonts or internal-border-width in fullscreen frames does not
    clutter display.  On multiple monitor environments, one can move
    fullscreen frames to another monitor by setting the `left' and
    `top' frame parameters accordingly.  Attaching/detaching external
    monitors should work even with fullscreen frames.
  * The `sticky' frame parameter, which allows us to keep particular
    frames visible for all Spaces on Mac OS X 10.5 and later.
  * The function `system-move-file-to-trash', which can be specified
    as a value of `delete-by-moving-to-trash'.
  * SVG image display.  This can be done via the WebKit framework on
    Mac OS X 10.4 and later, so you don't need librsvg.
  * Multi-page TIFF images.
  * The function `x-select-font' that provides modal font selection
    dialog in a compatible way with GTK+ and W32 ones.  Note that a
    nonmodal counterpart has been available since Emacs 22 Carbon port
    via `mac-font-panel-mode'.
  * Unicode character display including non-BMP ones.
  * Complex text layout (left-to-right only) and text shaping.  They
    are implemented using the Core Text or NS Text layout engine, so
    you don't need libotf.
  * Glyph selection with variation selectors.  Most of Adobe-Japan1
    ideographic glyphs are accessible via IVSes (Ideographic Variation
    Sequences) even for the OS-bundled Hiragino fonts, which do not
    contain the UVS subtable in their cmap table as of Mac OS X 10.6.

In addition to the standard Emacs 23.3 features, the Mac port includes
the following Mac-specific ones:

  * Pixel-based mouse wheel smooth scroll for newer mice/trackpads.
  * Gesture event handling for newer trackpads.  By default, pinch
    out/in are bound to text size scaling.  With the shift key, they
    turn on/off fullscreen status of the frame.
  * Apple event sending with (a)synchronous reply handling.  ODB
    Editor Suite support is added as an example.  (Only tested with
    QuickCursor.  Add "<string>org.gnu.Emacs</string>" to the elements
    of QCEditInChoices in QuickCursor.app/Contents/Info.plist.  On
    QuickCursor 2.0, you need to kill the buffer after saving it in
    order to reflect the changes to the original text area.)
  * "Click in the scroll bar to: Jump to the spot that's clicked"
    setting in the System Preferences is supported.
  * Change of text smoothing threshold setting in the Appearance pane
    of the System Preferences is reflected immediately.
  * Several keyboard shortcuts (notably those for Keyboard Navigation)
    listed in System Preferences just work like other applications.
  * When the clipboard has both textual and image data, yank inserts
    the former and push both into the kill ring so the latter can be
    inserted with yank-pop afterwards.
  * Use non-integral x positions for displaying antialiased
    proportional fonts.  You can see the difference by putting the box
    cursor over Helvetica 12pt `I', whose ideal width is 3.33398 but
    displayed with the rounded width 3, for example.
  * Emacs info nodes are accessible via search field in the Help menu
    on Mac OS X 10.6 and later.
  * Menu item "Open Selected File in Emacs" is shown in Services or
    context menu of other applications by default on Mac OS X 10.6
    and later when absolute pathname-like text is selected.
  * Reverse conversion in Kotoeri works even without selection.
    Hitting Eisu/Kana key on JIS keyboard (or Control-Shift-;/J/K on
    US keyboard) twice also works.
  * New function `mac-file-alias-p', which is parallel to
    `file-symlink-p'.
  * Experimental support for accessibility with respect to the custom
    view for Emacs frames.  Still there are several glitches.

As Quickdraw-style font rendering is considered obsolete as of Mac OS
X 10.5, the variable `mac-allow-anti-aliasing', which was supported in
the preceding ports (under a somewhat inappropriate name), is no
longer supported in the Mac port.  If you want to control
anti-aliasing, then you can set it with either from the Appearance
pane of the System Preferences, or the `AppleAntiAliasingThreshold'
property that can be set with the `defaults' command.  Alternatively,
you can specify nil or t for the `:antialias' property of a font-spec
to control anti-aliasing per font.

The Mac port doesn't support multi-tty with GUI.  I have no idea how I
can detach Emacs as a GUI application from Window Server or Dock
without separating a GUI process (not thread) from the main Emacs
(Lisp evaluator) process.


2. Build instructions

  NOTE: Some older versions of Xcode for Mac OS X 10.4 are known to be
  incompatible with newer versions of WebKit.  At least, Xcode 2.4.1
  works, but Xcode 2.1 has some problems.

  a. Get the official GNU Emacs 23.X distribution tarball from some
     GNU mirror site if this file is part of
     emacs-23.X-mac-V.W.tar.gz.  Or get the GNU Emacs 23.X.9Y pretest
     tarball from ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/ if this is
     part of emacs-23.X.9Y-mac-V.W.tar.gz.
     Untar the tarball.  Let EMACS_SOURCE_TOP be the top directory of
     the source tree.

  b. Apply the patch `patch-mac' to the source tree.

  c. Copy the subdirectory `mac' to `EMACS_SOURCE_TOP'.

  d. [Optional, Mac OS X 10.3 and later]
     If you want to use the icon bundled with Emacs 23, which is not
     compatible with Mac OS X 10.2, then copy
     `EMACS_SOURCE_TOP/nextstep/Cocoa/Emacs.base/Contents/Resources/Emacs.icns'
     to `EMACS_SOURCE_TOP/mac/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/Emacs.icns'
     by overriding the latter.

  e. Copy all the files in the `src' subdirectory to
     `EMACS_SOURCE_TOP/src'.

  f. Copy `lisp/term/mac-win.el' to
     `EMACS_SOURCE_TOP/lisp/term/mac-win.el'.

  g. Run configure with the "--with-mac" option.  You may also want to
     additionally specify "--enable-mac-app" to install the
     application bundle `Emacs.app' to /Applications.  If you want it
     to install in a different location, specify
     --enable-mac-app=MACAPPDIR.  Data files including Lisp files and
     helper executables are installed into /usr/local by default.  If
     you want to change the destination, give --prefix=PREFIXDIR.  See
     also `EMACS_SOURCE_TOP/INSTALL'.

     On Mac OS X 10.3 with a recent QuickTime update, you may also
     have to specify
     LDFLAGS="-Wl,-F/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks"
     so as to avoid link-time error.  This issue was also mentioned in
     etc/PROBLEMS in Emacs 22.

  h. make && make install.

  i. open /Applications/Emacs.app (or MACAPPDIR/Emacs.app) if
     `--enable-mac-app' was specified.  Otherwise, open
     EMACS_SOURCE_TOP/mac/Emacs.app.
